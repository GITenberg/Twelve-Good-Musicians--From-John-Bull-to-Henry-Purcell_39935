<h3>
INTRODUCTORY
</h3>

<p>
In the Preface of his admirable contribution
to the <i>Oxford History of Music</i> (Vol. III.) the late
Sir Hubert Parry writes: "The seventeenth
century is musically almost a blank, even to
those who take more than the average interest in
the Art; and barely a score of composers' names
during the whole time suggest anything more
than a mere reputation to modern ears."  Of
course the distinguished author is speaking of the
musical world in general, not of our own country's
music only.  I am inclined to think it is a little
severe on us.  I have always found that great
interest is taken in the 17th century music and
musicians of England.
</p>

<p>
Surely the century which began with the great
Madrigal school at its highest point, which saw
the Masque at its best in Milton's <i>Comus</i>, which
witnessed the supersession of the viol by the
violin, and which, at the close, had to its credit
the complete works of our greatest composer,
Henry Purcell, ought not to be in any sense
"almost a blank," to English students at least.
</p>

<p>
But if our musical students will only read
Volume III of the <i>Oxford History</i>&mdash;so full of the
author's admirable criticisms and so amply
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
illustrated by selections from the great
composers of the period&mdash;they will certainly form a
high opinion of what was accomplished then,
and, having finished the volume, their minds will
assuredly not be a "blank."
</p>

<p>
To help to a useful view of what was done
in our own country in the 17th century I took
that period for my University Course in this
session 1919-1920, and for my subject Twelve
Good Musicians from John Bull to Henry
Purcell.  The substance of these lectures is
given in the following chapters.
</p>

<p>
For many biographical details and other
matter I have availed myself of the valuable
articles in Grove's <i>Dictionary</i> and in the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, which I beg to
acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
To Mr Barclay Squire I am deeply indebted
for much information.  His work in Musical
History is most valuable, and deserves the best
thanks of all students.
</p>

<p>
To my brother, Professor J. C. Bridge, M.A.,
Mus.D., of Chester, and to Mr Jeffrey Pulver
and Dr Borland I am also grateful for many
interesting facts contained in these pages.

Twelve Good Musicians

<h3>
1. DR. JOHN BULL.
</h3>

<h4>
1563 (?)&mdash;1628.
</h4>

<p>
There is, I venture to think, a fitness in the
choice of the first musician of the Twelve to be
considered.  John Bull is a name familiar to
Englishmen, though I do not know that the
musician bearing that name has anything to do
with the historical and political personage whose
jovial portrait is so well known to us.  But
Dr. John Bull, was the first to hold anything
like a University Professorship in London&mdash;or
indeed in England.  It is true Gresham College
has not developed into a University, but its
founder, Sir Thomas Gresham, certainly seems
to have had such an end in view, and John Bull
was the first Gresham Music Lecturer.  As his
successor at Gresham College, and as I have the
honour to be the first Musical Professor in the
University of London, I think there is a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
justification for beginning this course in the University
with a consideration of the old Gresham Professor.
I must premise that in selecting twelve good
men I have by no means exhausted the number
of such men available, but I hope to have chosen
good representatives of the various Schools and
movements in the musical world of England in
the 17th century.  And, although necessarily
concentrating my attention on the selected
twelve, yet, of course, undoubtedly I shall make
many references to their fellow-musicians both
in this country and abroad.  But it is to our own
men and our own music in the 17th century that
I shall direct my chief attention.
</p>

<p>
To begin then with the first of my twelve good
musicians&mdash;the first Gresham Professor of Music,
Dr. John Bull.  Born about 1563 of a Somersetshire
family, he became one of the Children of the
Chapel Royal (as will be seen, always a great
nursery of young English Musicians), his master
being Blytheman who, we are told, "spared
neither time nor labour to advance his natural gifts."
</p>

<p>
Organist of Hereford Cathedral for a time, we
find him in 1585 a member of the Chapel Royal
Choir&mdash;not then organist, a post to which he
attained a few years later, succeeding his old
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
master, Blytheman.  He was evidently determined
to get on in his profession, for, besides all these
posts and varied activities, he found time in
1586 to take the degree of Bachelor of Music
at Oxford (it being stated he had "practised the
faculty of music for 14 years"), following this up
with a Doctor's degree&mdash;this time at Cambridge.
</p>

<p>
He appears to have met with a somewhat
serious adventure at Tewkesbury, in 1592,
"being robbed in those parts."  A Mr. W. Chelps,
of Tewkesbury showed him "rare kindness"
and was rewarded, no doubt by Bull's influence,
with the post of a Gentleman Extraordinary in
the Chapel Royal.
</p>

<p>
In 1592 our indefatigable musician took
another degree, that of Doctor of Music at
Oxford, the delay in taking it having been caused,
according to a contemporary writer, by his
having met with "rigid puritans there, that
could not endure Church Music."
</p>

<p>
The next important step in his varied career
was his appointment as first Gresham Professor
of Music.  His lectures should have been given
in Latin, but he was allowed to deliver them in
English.  Unfortunately there is no copy of his
lectures to be found, but Mr. Barclay Squire in an
article on Bull in the Dictionary of National
Biography, gives the following title-page of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
the first lecture which is all that survives
of it:
</p>

<p>
"<i>The oration of Master John Bull, Doctor of
Music and one of the Gentlemen of his Majestie's
Royal Chapel, as he pronounced the same before
divers worshipful persons the Aldermen and
Commoners of the Citie of London, with a great
multitude of other people the</i> 6<i>th day of October</i>
1597,<i> in the new erected College of Sir Thomas
Gresham, Knight, deceased: made in the
Commemoration of the said worthy Founder, and the
excellent Science of Musicke.</i>  (Imprinted at
London by Thomas Este)."
</p>

<p>
Although a great misfortune that the Lecture
itself is not to be found; it is interesting to
learn the subject of the oration from the title-page.
</p>

<p>
It would, however, have been more interesting
to read the lecture itself, if only to see what
Bull said about Sir Thomas Gresham and to
know his views upon music in general.  Of one
thing we may be certain: he must have given
his audience a real treat by his Clavier
performance; for doubtless he obeyed the directions
given in the Founder's will&mdash;directions which are
observed to this day.  It was wise on the part
of Gresham to insist that the lectures should
be adequately illustrated: an audience gains
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
much from <i>hearing the examples</i> which have been
commented upon by the lecturer.  The directions are:
</p>

<p class="block">
"The solemn music lectures twice every week,
in manner following, viz: the theoretique part for
one half hour or thereabouts, and the practique by
concert of voice or instruments for the rest of
the hour."
</p>

<p>
Bull has been credited with the composition of
our National Anthem.  The matter has been
investigated by many, but, so far, there seems
no proof of it.  We know, however, that he was
honoured by King James I, as his name was
amongst those to whom were given "gold chains,
plates, or medals."
</p>

<p>
He appears to have been admitted into the
freedom of the Merchant Taylors' Company in
1606, and in 1607 he played before the King and
Prince Henry when they dined at Merchant
Taylors' Hall.  According to Stowe, "John Bull,
Doctor of Music, one of the Organists of His
Majestie's Chapel Royal and free of the Merchant
Taylors', being in a citizen's goune, cappe and
hood, played most excellent melodie upon a small
payre of Organs placed there for that purpose only."
</p>

<p>
The Musical arrangements for this great City
Company's feast were on a very elaborate scale.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
Besides Bull's performance (which was apparently
for the King only, who dined alone in a separate
chamber "where Dr. Bull did play all dinner
time"), the Singing Men and Children of the
Royal Chapel sang melodious songs, and some
of the best singers of the day sang songs by
Coperario, from a ship which was suspended in the
great Hall.  Besides all this the Choir of St
Paul's sang songs, the words of which were by
Ben Jonson.  The King must have had a pretty
good programme of music to listen to, unless he
spent the evening in his own room where he
dined alone&mdash;with Dr Bull playing to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
The numerous singers in the great Hall seem
to have been rather a trouble to the givers of the
feast.  Bull and Gyles, the master of the
Children of the Chapel Royal, who performed in the
King's chamber, were rewarded the next day
by being admitted into the livery of the Company
as a recognition of their services at the
entertainment, which are stated to have been "gratis,
whereas the musicians in the greate Hall exacted
unreasonable somes of the Company for the same."
</p>

<p>
During an absence abroad in 1601 his deputy
at Gresham College was Thomas Byrd, son of the
composer W. Byrd.  Bull's fame had so spread
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
that he had many tempting offers to attach
himself to the "French and Spanish Courts," but
he obeyed Queen Elizabeth's order to return to
England.
</p>

<p>
In 1607, on account of a desire to marry, he
relinquished the Gresham post, celibacy being one
of the conditions of the appointment.  The lady
of his choice was "Elizabeth Walter of the
Strand, maiden, aged about 24, daughter of
Walter, citizen of London."
</p>

<p>
Nothing much is chronicled of him for the next
four years, but in 1611 his name heads the list
of the Prince of Wales' musicians at a salary of
£40 a year, and another mention is made of him
in connection with Princess Elizabeth's marriage,
on which occasion (Feb. 14th, 1613) a benediction,
<i>God the Father, God the Son</i>, was sung to an
anthem "made new for that purpose by Dr. Bull."
</p>

<p>
We now come to the mysterious portion of
Bull's life which culminated in his flight from
England.  The first hint is suggested by the
following letter from Bull to Sir M. Hicks,
secretary to the Earl of Salisbury:
</p>

<p class="block">
"Sir,
</p>

<p class="block">
I have bin many times to have spoken with
you, to desire your favor to my Lord and
Mr. Chancellor, to graunte me theire favors to chaunge
my name, and put in my childes, leaving out my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
owne.  It is but £40 by yeare for my service
heretofore, the matter is not great, yet it will be some
reliefe for my poor childe, having nothing ells to
leave it."
</p>

<p>
The letter proceeds to mention some others
whose interest had been moved, and is written in
a tone of great humiliation.  Was it an instance
of coming events casting their shadows before?
The following entry in the Chapel Royal
cheque-book rather supports the supposition:
</p>

<p class="block">
"John Bull, Doctor of Music, went beyond the
seas without licence, and was admitted into the
Archduke's Service, and entered into paie there
about Michaelmas."
</p>

<p>
Peter Hopkins filled his place, and his quarter's
salary, Michaelmas to Christmas, was divided
amongst members of the Royal Chapel.
</p>

<p>
His departure created some sensation, as it is
said he "was so much admired for his dexterous
hand on the Organ, that many thought there
was more than man in him."  Wood puts it down
to his "being possessed with crotchets, as many
musicians are."  A letter, however, from the
British Minister at Brussels to King James I,
puts a rather different complexion on it.  It
would appear that the Minister had been charged
by James I, to express his displeasure at the
Archduke's want of courtesy in engaging Bull,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
and in the letter announcing the fulfilment of his
mission the Minister says:
</p>

<p class="block">
"And I told him plainly, that it was notorious
to all the world, the said Bull did not leave your
Majesty's Service for any wrong done unto him or
for matter of Religion, under which fained pretext
he sought to wrong the reputation of your Majesty's
justice, but did in that dishonest manner steal out
of England through the guilt of a corrupt conscience
to escape punishment which notoriously he had
deserved and was designed to have been inflicted
on him by the hand of justice for his
..... grievous crimes."
</p>

<p>
It will be noticed the writer scoffs at Bull's
religious sensitiveness, but there is no doubt he
was, like Byrd, a Papist at heart.
</p>

<p>
In 1617 he succeeded Waelrant at Antwerp
Cathedral, dying in that city on the 12th or 13th
of March, 1628, and being buried in the Cathedral.
</p>

<p>
Bull was evidently well thought of by his
Antwerp friends, and Sweelinck, the great Dutch
organist, included a Canon by Bull in his work
on Composition.  Bull returned the compliment
by writing a Fantasia on a Fugue by Sweelinck.
</p>

<p>
Bull is most favourably known as a composer
for the Virginals.  Many fine examples are to be
found in the <i>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</i>, and his
powers as performer must have been very great,
judging from his compositions.  He joined Byrd
and Gibbons in contributing to the celebrated
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
collection <i>Parthenia</i> ("the first music for the
Virginals ever published in England.")  There
are examples of his Church Music in Boyce's
Cathedral Music (1760), but, like many other
specimens contained in that valuable and
well-known collection, these compositions of Bull
do not seem to me to be the best examples
of his powers.  A really beautiful little motet
contained in Sir William Leighton's <i>Teares and
Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soule</i> (1614) entitled
<i>In the Departure of the Lord</i> gives me a very high
opinion of his Church Music.  It is for four
voices and full of beautiful harmony and
expressive modulation.  Indeed, I think it compares
favourably with much of the kind written by
contemporary musicians.
</p>

<p>
I hope to be able to edit it, with other specimens
of Bull's sacred music, in the early future.
</p>

<p>
A portrait exists in the University of Oxford,
and round it is written
</p>

<p class="poem">
"The Bull by force in field doth rayne<br />
But Bull by skill good-will doth gaine."<br />
</p>

<p>
A copy of this portrait is prefixed to this book.

<h3>
II. WILLIAM BYRD
</h3>

<h4>
1542 or 3&mdash;1623
</h4>

<p>
A great contemporary of John Bull comes next
for consideration.  William Byrd is certainly
one of the most distinguished of the remarkable
company of English composers living in the
early years of the 17th century.  Curiously
enough, he was not included amongst the
contributors to <i>The Triumphs of Oriana</i>.  There may
be a reason, of which more anon.  Anthony
Wood tells us "he was bred up to musick under
Thomas Tallis," and the eminent Church musician
was god-father to Byrd's son Thomas.  Byrd
was also Tallis' executor.  In early life the
subject of my Lecture was Organist of Lincoln,
in which city he was married on the 14th
of September, 1568.  His eldest son was born at
Lincoln in 1569, and a daughter in 1571-2.  This
proves he did not at once come to London on his
appointment to the Chapel Royal.  This was
in 1569, when he succeeded Robert Parsons as
Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, the said Robert
Parsons having been drowned at Newark in
January of that year.  It seems probable that
Byrd kept up some kind of connection with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
Lincoln for some time after his appointment to
the Chapel Royal, for an entry in the Chapter
Records of Lincoln mentions the appointment
of Thomas Butler as Organist and Master of the
Choristers on the "nomination and commendation
of Mr William Byrd."  In London he shared
with his old master, Tallis, the post of Organist
of the Royal Chapel and he also enjoyed with him
a privilege of a more profitable nature, which
was no less than a patent, granted by Queen
Elizabeth to print and sell music, English or
foreign, and to rule, print and sell music paper
for twenty-one years, and all other printers were
forbidden to infringe this license under penalty
of forty shillings.  A petition from some printers,
having reference to this license, shows it was not
altogether a popular privilege.  The complainants
say: "Byrd and Tallys, her Majesty's
Servants, have musicke bokes with note, <i>which
the Complainants confess they would not print</i>,
nor be furnished to print, tho' there were no
privilege."  I think this may be regarded as a
little specimen of professional jealousy.
</p>

<p>
Whether the privilege was a great financial
benefit to the two old Masters one cannot say,
but, anyhow, it was of great advantage in one
way, and that was the opportunity it gave of
printing and publishing their own works, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
Byrd was not slow in taking advantage of it.
In 1575 appeared his first published work, as
a set of "Cantiones" in 4, 5, and 6 parts.
Some of the compositions were by Tallis and
some by Byrd, and they are fine and dignified
specimens of both composers.  One by Tallis in
particular is a beautiful example of his treatment
of a Chorale, the parts flowing in charming
melody and the whole work abounding in
interesting and clever "imitation."  I have
been able to publish this fine example of early
Church music, and it has been well received
"in Quires and places where they sing."  With
the exception of "If ye love me" I do not know
any anthem by Tallis which compares with it in
solemn and chaste expression.  It shows Byrd's
old master&mdash;one of the founders of our Cathedral
music&mdash;at his very best.
</p>

<p>
On the death of Tallis 1585, the patent was
enjoyed by Byrd alone, and he made very good
use of it.  One of his first publications was
entitled <i>Psalmes, Sonets, and Songs of sadness
and pietie, made into musicke of</i> 5 <i>parts; whereof
some of them going abroad among divers, in untrue
coppies, are heere truely corrected, and the other
being Songs very rare and newly composed, are
heere published, for the recreation of all such as
delight in Musicke</i> (1588).
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
</p>

<p>
At the back of the title-page of this work are the
following "Eight Reasons briefly set down by
the Author to perswade every one to learn to sing:"
</p>

<p class="block">
1. First it is a knowledge easily taught and
quickly learned where there is a good Master and
an apt Scholar.
</p>

<p class="block">
2. The exercise of singing is delightful to Nature,
and good to preserve the health of Man.
</p>

<p class="block">
3. It doth strengthen all parts of the breast and
doth open the pipes.
</p>

<p class="block">
4. It is a singular good remedy for Stutting[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]
and Stammering in the speech.
</p>

<p class="block">
5. It is the best means to procure a perfect
pronunciation, and to make a good Orator.
</p>

<p class="block">
6. It is the only way to know where Nature
hath bestowed the benefit of a good voice, which
gift is so rare, as there is not one among a thousand
that hath it, and in many that excellent gift is lost,
because they want Art to express Nature.
</p>

<p class="block">
7. There is not any Musicke of Instruments
whatsoever comparable to that which is made of the
voices of Men, where the voices are good and the
same well sorted and ordered.
</p>

<p class="block">
8. The better the voice is the meeter it is to
honour and serve God therewith, and the voice of
man is Chiefly to be imployed to that End."
</p>

<p>
To the above is added the following couplet:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Since Singing is so good a thing<br />
I wish all men would learne to sing.<br />
</p>

<p>
In the same year appeared a work which was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
destined to wield tremendous influence upon
English Musical Art.  This was a collection of
Madrigals called <i>Musica Transalpina</i>.  <i>Madrigals
translated out of</i> 4, 5, <i>and</i> 6 <i>parts, chosen out
of divers excellent Authors, with the first and
second parts of La Virginella made by MAISTER
BYRD upon two stanzas of Ariosto and brought to
speak English with the rest</i>.  The inclusion of his
name in this connection gives Byrd the claim to
be considered one of the first, if not the first, of
English Madrigal writers.  And the fact that he
contributed to this work may have possibly
been the cause of the absence of his name from
the collection made by Morley&mdash;which, of course,
was an imitation of the publication which had
appeared some twelve years before.  This is
merely a supposition, but there must be some
reason for the exclusion of such a distinguished
composer, and one already famous as a Madrigal
writer.  It is the more remarkable from the fact
that Morley spoke of Byrd with the greatest
respect and even affection.[<a id="chap02fn2text"></a><a href="#chap02fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
Two years later he wrote two settings of <i>This
sweet and merry month of May</i> for Watson's
<i>First sett of Italian Madrigals Englished</i>.  Among
his other vocal compositions are <i>Psalms, Songs
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
and Sonets, some solemne, other joyfull framed to
the life of the words</i>.  <i>Fit for voyces or viols</i>.  He
also was a contributor to Leighton's <i>Teares
and Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soul</i>, the work in
which Bull's beautiful Motet appears.  One of
his works he dedicated to the Earl of Northampton,
and the dedication infers that not only had
Byrd reason to be grateful to that nobleman,
but so also had the Gentlemen of the Chapel
Royal, as he seems to have been the means of
securing an increase in their salaries.  Of course
many of Byrd's works were not published, and
this is particularly the case with his compositions
for the Virginals.  Many are in the <i>Fitzwilliam
Virginal Book</i>[<a id="chap02fn3text"></a><a href="#chap02fn3">3</a>] and also in <i>Lady Nevill's Booke</i>,
which is a collection of Virginal Lessons, copied
by a singing Man of Windsor named John Baldwin.
Before leaving Byrd's professional life it
is interesting to note his connection with another
musical worthy contemporary, Alfonso Ferabosco;
a joint publication of theirs will show this.
It was entitled <i>Medulla Musicke, sucked out of the
sappe of Two of the most famous Musicians that
ever lived, Master William Byrd and Master Alfonso
Ferabosco, Either of whom having made 40 severall
ways (without contention) shewing most rare and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
intricate skill in 2 parts in one upon the Plaine
Song Miserere</i>.  This work was most probably the
outcome of a "friendly contention" which they
had "each one judging his rival's work, they
both set plaine song 40 different ways."
</p>

<p>
In private life Byrd's religious feelings made
his career rather an anxious one; like many
others on the Chapel Royal Staff, though
outwardly Protestant, he was probably a Roman
Catholic.  It was known that the Byrd family
were "Papisticall recusants"; as early as 1581
he is mentioned as living at one of the places
frequented by recusants, and is also set down as
"a friend and abettor of those beyond the Sea,
and is said to be living with Mr. Lister over
against St Dunstans or at the Lord Padgettes
house at Draighton."  It is a noticeable thing
that though his duties called him to the Chapel
Royal, he lived nearly the whole of his life out
of London.  At one place, Stondon, Essex, he
had some sequestrated property granted to him
for three lives, but had a good deal of dispute with
the previous owners, which went so far as to
necessitate the King's intervention.  In a
law-suit in connection with it "one Petiver submitted
the said Byrd did give him vile and bitter words,"
that when told he had no right to the property
replied that "yf he could not hould it by right
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
he would hould it by might."  Byrd lived a long
life, and died on July 4, 1623.
</p>

<p>
The exact entry recording this fact in the
Chapel Royal Cheque Book runs "1623, William
Byrd, a Father of Musick, died the 4th of July,
and John Croker, a Counter Tenor of Westminster,
was admitted for a year of probation of
his good behaviour and civill carriage."
</p>

<p>
Mr Barclay Squire has discovered much of
interest concerning Byrd, notably his Will.  In
this he expresses a hope that he "may live and
dye a true and perfect member of God's holy
Catholic Church, (without which I believe there
is no salvation for me).  My body to be honourably
buried in that parish or place where it shall
please God to take me oute of this life, which I
humbly desyre (if it shall please God) may be in
the parish of Stondon where my dwellinge is,
and this to be buried neare unto the place where
my wife lyeth buryed."
</p>

<p>
Of late years much attention has been devoted
to Byrd's sacred music, which includes some
remarkably fine Masses, some of which have been
reprinted and used in the Roman Catholic
Church.  But Byrd has never been forgotten in
the Cathedrals of England, for his Anthem <i>Bow
Thine ear</i> has always found a place in the lists of
the daily musical services.  There is, also, a fine
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
specimen of his composition in the volume of
Cathedral music published by Dr. Hayes.  It has
English words, and for a long time appeared in the
Abbey list as by Hayes, but it was identified as
one of Byrd's Latin motets, and now is ascribed
to the rightful owner.
</p>

<p>
An interesting specimen of his Clavier
compositions is to be found in the Fitzwilliam volume
being an arrangement of the air <i>O Mistress Mine</i>.
This is one of the few pieces of Shakesperean
music which was published in the Poet's life-time.
It is charmingly treated by Byrd.  The same
air appeared in a work by Morley, an arrangement
of various airs for a small Band consisting
of the Treble Viol, Flute, Cittern, Pandora, Lute,
and Bass Viol.  It seems probable that this
air was a popular tune and that Shakespeare
wrote words to it, or possibly (as he did in
<i>Willo! Willo!</i>) took the old words which were set to the
melody and incorporated them in his play.
</p>

<p>
A contemporary opinion of Byrd can be
gathered from Peacham's estimate of him in the
<i>Compleat Gentleman</i>.  Writing in 1622, he says:
"In Motets and Musicks of piety and devotion, as
well for the honour of our nation as the merit of
the man, I preferre above all other our Phoenix,
Mr. Wm. Byrd, whom, in that kind, I know not
whether any may equall, I am sure none excell,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
even by the judgment of France and Italy.  His
<i>Cantiones Sacrae</i> and also his <i>Gradualia</i> are
meere Angelicall and Divine and being himself
naturally disposed to gravity and piety, his
veine is not so much for light Madrigals and
Canzonets, yet his Virginella and some others
in his first set cannot be mended by the best
Italian of them all."  And Morley speaks of him
as "my loving master, never without reuerence
to be named of Musicians."
</p>

<p>
His name has always been associated with the
Canon <i>Non nobis Domine</i>, but it would be very
difficult to establish his claim to the authorship.
</p>

<p>
Altogether the old musician has a remarkable
list of varied compositions to his credit.  Besides
those already mentioned he wrote some excellent
<i>Fancies</i> and <i>In Nomines</i> for strings, making a real
advance upon the somewhat stilted specimens of
Instrumental Music then in vogue, and helping to
free the Instrumental form of composition from
the vocal.  <i>Fancies</i> and <i>In Nomines</i> I shall speak
of in detail in a later lecture.
</p>

<p>
William Byrd had a long and honourable career
and contributed in a remarkable degree to the
development of the Art of Music in England in the
17th century.  There is much truth in Peacham's
verdict that his music "cannot be mended by the
best Italian of them all."

<h3>
III. THOMAS MORLEY.
</h3>

<h4>
1557&mdash;1603
</h4>

<p>
The next of our twelve musicians in chronological
order of birth is Thomas Morley, born in 1557,
when Byrd was a young man, though his course
was run long before that veteran had finished
with the affairs of this world.  He was a pupil
of Byrd, and was probably a chorister of St
Paul's Cathedral.  In 1588 he graduated B.Mus. at
Oxford, and some three years later was
appointed Organist of St Paul's.  This position
he did, however, not hold long, as in 1592, he
was appointed a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.
In 1598 he was granted the licence, which had
previously been held by Tallis and Byrd, for the
exclusive right of printing and selling Books of
Music and Ruled Paper, and many of the musical
works which were published at that time were
issued by Este, Peter Short, William Barley,
and others, as the assigns of Thomas Morley.
In 1602 he resigned his positions at the Chapel
Royal, probably from ill-health, as one gathers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
from the Introduction to his <i>Plaine and Easie
Introduction to Practical Music</i> that he was
rather a confirmed invalid.  Some have taken
the year of his resignation as that of his death,
but there is nothing to support this, and though
Hawkins and Burney are at one in placing his
death in 1604, the correct date is 1603.
</p>

<p>
Details of Morley's life are scanty, by his
works we must know him.  His compositions
are both vocal and instrumental, sacred and
secular; and, in addition to his work in the
various branches of composition, much of his
fame rests upon his authorship of the first really
satisfactory treatise on music, <i>The Plaine and
Easie Introduction</i> already referred to.
</p>

<p>
This work is full of interest, and has been a
book of reference and of valuable information to
musicians for the past three centuries.  Written
in the form of a dialogue between Master and
Pupil, it contains many quaint discourses, and it
is in the early chapters of this work that the
story is told of the unfortunate gentleman who
could not read music at sight when asked to do
so by his hostess, with the humiliating result
that the company wondered "where he had
been brought up."
</p>

<p>
Morley's book was translated into German by
I. C. Frost, Organist of St Martin's, Halberstadt.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
It is interesting to observe that more than one
of his works was translated into German
(e.g., the <i>Canzonets or Little Short Songs to Three
Voyces</i>, published here first in 1593, was
translated into German and issued at Cassel in 1612
and at Rostock in 1624; and the <i>Ballets for
Five Voyces</i> of 1595 was issued at Nuremberg
in 1609).
</p>

<p>
This is a striking testimony to his merits, but
the most celebrated of his publications was the
great edition of Madrigals called <i>The Triumphs
of Oriana</i>.  This is said to have been compiled as
a tribute to Queen Elizabeth, whose title of
"Gloriana" is well known.  In this portly
volume he includes no fewer than twenty-six
Madrigals, contributed by many of the most
famous living English composers.  The work
helped to make the practice of Madrigal-singing
very popular in England, and to this day its
influence is great and few programmes of Madrigal-music
are ever issued without some specimen
taken from this splendid collection.
</p>

<p>
And it is to Morley we owe a delightful
contemporary setting of words by Shakespeare&mdash;the
beautiful Lyric "It was a lover and his lass"
from <i>As You Like It</i>.  This is one of the very
few things which we possess&mdash;with the words by
Shakespeare and the music by a contemporary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
musician.  Unfortunately, the charming song
has been often sadly mutilated by editors,
sometimes by the introduction of unwarranted
"accidentals" and also by actual curtailment.  I have,
however, had the opportunity of referring to one
of the few copies in existence of the original
publication (formerly in the Halliwell-Phillip's
collection), and have so been enabled to issue
it in its correct form.  Various attempts have
been made to arrange it as a duet, on the ground
that it was sung in the play by "two pages."  The
dialogue which precedes the song is very
amusing and rather suggests that Shakespeare
had some little experience of the peculiar
weaknesses of singers, both amateur and professional.
The following is the little episode in question:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Enter Two Pages.</i>
</p>

<pre>
    1st Page: Well met, honest gentleman.

  Touchstone: By my troth, well met.  Come sit, sit and a song.

    2nd Page: We are for you: sit i' the middle.

    1st Page: Shall we clap into't roundly, without
                hawking or spitting or saying we are
                hoarse; which are the only prologues
                to a bad voice?

    2nd Page: I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune,
                like two gipsies on a horse.
              <i>As You Like It</i>, Act V., scene 3.
</pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The words "two gipsies on a horse" have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
taken to suggest that as the two gipsies must
have ridden one behind the other, the two
pages should sing, not in unison, but one
after the other.  Hence the effort to arrange the
music in Canon, as it is termed.  But there is no
warrant for this; neither will the song admit
of it.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
With respect to his Instrumental writing, in
addition to many examples for the Virginals,
he wrote for combined instruments, as will be seen
later.  Much of his Virginal-music is contained
in the <i>Fitzwilliam Collection</i>, and in Will Forster's
<i>Virginal Book</i> in Buckingham Palace.  For
combined instruments may be mentioned the
seven Fantasias, and there is also a collection
called <i>First Book of Consort Lessons for Six
Instruments, Lute, Pandora, Cittern, Bass Viol,
Flute and Treble Viol</i>.  Writing on this
collection Dr Burney does not take a very high
estimate of its musical value: "they seem to
have been intended for Civic Feasts" (he says),
"and Master Morley, supposing perhaps that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
the harmony which was to be heard through the
clattering of knives, forks, spoons, and plates,
with the jingling of glasses and clamorous
conversation of a City feast, need not be very
accurate or refined, was not very nice in setting
parts to these tunes, which are so far from correct
that almost any one of the City Waits would have
vamped as good an accompaniment on the spot."
</p>

<p>
I question if Dr Burney is justified in this
scathing criticism.  I do not suppose he ever
heard them performed, for the good reason that
there is no complete set of parts to be found,
and there is no record of any such being in
existence in his time.  A few years ago I did my
best to get these little "Band tunes" performed,
but at first only the Viol and Flute parts could
be found.  Later on I was fortunate enough to
discover a Cittern part in the Bodleian Library,
and, later still, a part for the Pandora has been
found in the Christ Church Library.  We still
want the parts for Lute and Bass Viol, but with
these four we get a very good representation of
the original, and at the Exhibition initiated by
the Worshipful Company of Musicians we had
one of these little tunes played by the six
instruments, under the direction of the Rev. W. Galpin.
We had to supply parts for Lute and Bass Viol,
but as we had the original Harmony supplied
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
by the Flute (i.e. a small Recorder), which was
an inner part, and by the Cittern and Pandora&mdash;both
of which played Chords&mdash;we could not go
far wrong.  The effect was both interesting and
charming, and altogether discounted Burney's
unreliable criticism.  It would be a great delight
to all lovers of this early music if the two missing
parts could be found, but I fear we shall hunt in vain.
</p>

<p>
His Sacred works include two Services and an
Anthem, which was published in Barnard's
collection, and a setting of the Burial Service,
which appears in Boyce's collection.  There are
also examples, in MS. amongst the Harleian
MSS., in the Christ Church Library at Oxford,
and the Fitzwilliam and Peterhouse Libraries
at Cambridge.  A curious thing, rather, in
connection with his Sacred works is, that, unlike
his secular compositions, none was published
during his lifetime.
</p>

<p>
His style was not so broad as that of Tallis or
so noble as that of Byrd, but he had a great
influence upon the art.  His own compositions
include examples of his talent in many directions.
As a theoretical writer he is really distinguished
above his contemporaries, and contributed to
the stores of Sacred, Secular, and Instrumental
music, besides writing for the stage.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
</p>

<p>
Morley's early death was a real loss to English
music, and he was mourned by all his
contemporaries.  One of the most touching testimonies
is a beautiful <i>Lament for Six Voices</i> by Thomas
Weelkes, himself a distinguished composer, whom
we shall consider later.  The words are as follows:
</p>

<p class="block">
A remembrance of my friend Mr. Thomas Morley.
</p>

<p class="poem">
Death hath deprived me of my dearest friend,<br />
My dearest friend is dead and laid in grave,<br />
In grave he rests until the world shall end,<br />
The world shall end, as end must all things have.<br />
All things must have an end that nature wrought<br />
That nature wrought must unto dust be brought.<br />
</p>

<p>
Another poetical testimony to Morley was
written in his life-time, and may be given here.
It is supposed to be by Michael Drayton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Such was old Orpheus' cunning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That senseless things drew near him;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And herds of beasts to hear him.<br />
The stock, the stone, the ox, the ass came running.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morley! but this enchanting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee, to be the music god, is wanting;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet thou needst not fear him.<br />
Draw thou the shepherds still, and bonny lasses,<br />
And envy him not stocks, stones, oxen, asses.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] Mr Arkwright gives us an interesting bit of information
in connection with Morley and Shakespeare.  "Morley
lived in St Peter's, Bishopsgate, between 1596 and 1601,
and his name appears in two <i>Rolls of Assessments for
Subsidies</i>.  In the earlier of these documents is the name of
William Shakespeare, his goods being valued at the same
amount as Morley's.  He and Shakespeare both appealed
against the assessment, and it may be supposed some amount
of personal intercourse existed between them."

<h3>
IV. THOMAS WEELKES
</h3>

<h4>
1575?&mdash;1623
</h4>

<p>
In the previous Lecture I have mentioned
Thomas Weelkes, and now turn for a short space
to this distinguished composer.  As I have said
before, I do not profess to include all the great
English musicians of the 17th century in this
short series of Lectures, and Weelkes is selected,
not only as being greatly superior to many
others, but because he has given us something
original in the shape of combined Instrumental
and Vocal work, in addition to his valuable
contributions to the Madrigal School.  Of this I
must speak later.  As a Madrigal-writer he is
notable as one of the "glorious company" of
contributors to <i>The Triumphs of Oriana</i>.
Although little of his Church music is published,
yet as Organist of Chichester Cathedral and,
as a member of the Choir of the Chapel Royal,
he was an experienced Church musician.  He
left many Anthems, which are preserved in
MS. in various Libraries; and he contributed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
two pieces to Leighton's <i>Teares and Lamentations
of a Sorrowful Soul</i>.  In his <i>Fancies for Strings</i>
he displays a very fertile imagination.  I have
had some of his <i>Fancies</i> performed at my
various Lectures, and have found them remarkable
for melodic interest and very advanced as
regards Harmony.  His instrumental writing
is surprising; and, when one compares his
Fancies with those by Orlando Gibbons, one is
astonished at the novelty of his ideas.  As will
be seen later I shall have much to say in
connection with Gibbons, Deering, and Purcell in
regard to the Fancy.  But I may as well at once
explain that this was the form which was supreme
in the early days of the 17th century as a vehicle
for Instrumental writing.  An enormous number
of these compositions exist, and it was not until
Purcell's time that the Fancy disappeared&mdash;being
supplanted by the Sonatas for three strings and a
Basso Continuo.  It was a form which helped
on the progress of writing for Instruments in a
wonderful way.  "Apt for Voices and Viols"
was the usual title-page which composers loved.
But, when the Fancy developed, the writing was
far too elaborate to be "apt for voices," and so
we get the independent instrumental Fancy.  It
was, as a rule, a work of some considerable
length, and, while full of variety, it was lacking in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
any real development.  The composer indulged
his "Fancy," and wandered from point to point
at his own sweet will.
</p>

<p>
It was with the Fancy that Weelkes made an
early experiment of adding a vocal part quite
independent of the strings.  And he took for his
vocal part the popular series of "Cryes" which
were then common to the streets of London.
He did not, as has so often been wrongly stated,
"set the Cryes of London to music," but he took
the words and the music of these old and very
interesting things and added the vocal part to
what was a real Fancy for strings.  It is said
Morley did the same thing, but I have, so far,
failed to find any example of it.  Ravenscroft
took many of these same old Cryes and worked
them up as Rounds, and Campion introduced
<i>Cherry Ripe</i> into a charming song "There is a
Garden in her face" in 1617; but the <i>Humorous
Fancy</i> by Weelkes is, so far as I can see at present,
the earliest of this kind of work.  Later, in
connection with Gibbons and Deering, I shall
have much to say on this subject, as these
composers also wrote <i>Humorous Fancies</i>, the vocal
parts being the same old Cryes of London but
treated in a more elaborate manner.
</p>

<p>
Weelkes' example is very charming, and
although his string parts are somewhat stilted,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
yet there is always life in them.  He makes one
point which shows he was not altogether able
to forget his Madrigals and Ballets.  Like the
latter, the <i>Fancy</i> at one point leaves its regular
course, and for a few bars a delightful Dance
tune is introduced, to the words&mdash;whatever they
mean&mdash;"Twincledowne Tavye."  It is as if the
vendors of fish, fruit and vegetables met in the
street and had a bit of a frolic together.  The
Fancy is resumed with the Cryes of the Chimney
Sweep, Bellows-Mender etc., and later on a
beautiful song for the seller of "Broome" is
introduced.  The words of this song date back
before Weelkes, being found with slight variation
in an old play called <i>Three Ladies of London</i>,
1584.  They are sung by a character named
"Conscience" who enters with brooms, and
sings the song.
</p>

<p>
No doubt the tune given by Weelkes is the
original one.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion of this Fancy is very charming
and rather like an Anthem:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then let us sing<br />
And so we will make an end<br />
With Alleluia.<br />
</p>

<p>
There are two MSS. of this work in the British
Museum.  I have followed the shorter version,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
as the longer is not only rather dull and
prolonged but includes a little deviation into
vulgarity, and so is hardly suitable for modern
ears.  The "Alleluia" occurs in the longer
MS. and I have included it in my version.
</p>

<p>
It is fortunate that there are two sets of
parts, as neither of them is complete.  But
having been so fortunate as to find these two
sets I have been able to restore the missing part.
</p>

<p>
The discovery of this Fancy is the reason why
I select Weelkes instead of Wilbye, one of
his great contemporaries, and I think all
lovers of Shakespeare will be glad to make
acquaintance with the music of the <i>Cryes of
London</i> which saluted the Poet's ears in his
daily walks.
</p>

<p>
Weelkes paid a loving tribute to "his dearest
friend" Morley, on the latter's death.  The
date of Weelkes' death (1623) and other
particulars have been brought to light by the
investigations of the Rev. Dr. Fellowes, whose
devotion to the madrigal school is so well
known and appreciated.  His paper on Weelkes
(Musical Association, May, 1916) is an eloquent
testimony to the worth of this composer, to whose
madrigal writing I have not space quite to do
justice.  The <i>Humorous Fancy</i>, however, shows
him in a new and interesting light.

<h3>
V. ORLANDO GIBBONS
</h3>

<h4>
1583&mdash;1625
</h4>

<p>
Orlando Gibbons is certainly the most
outstanding name of the English musicians in the
early part of the 17th century.  A good deal of
this is, no doubt, due to the fact that his
contributions to Sacred Music have been one of the
great possessions of our Cathedral School, and
their presence in service lists has been&mdash;and I
venture to hope will always be&mdash;a constant
tribute to their excellence.
</p>

<p>
Gibbons' upbringing was, of course, such as
turned his mind naturally, though by no means
exclusively, to Church Music.
</p>

<p>
He was the son of one of the City waifs of
Cambridge, William Gibbons, and was born in
1583.  Placed in the Choir of King's College,
he is mentioned amongst the Choristers during
the years 1596-97; at which time his elder
brother, Edward Gibbons, was Organist of the
College.  It might be noted in passing that this
Edward Gibbons was himself a B.Mus. of both
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
Universities; and, after occupying an
appointment at Bristol at the beginning of the 17th
century, was, later, organist and Priest Vicar
at Exeter Cathedral, where he had to answer a
charge of neglecting his duties; this, however,
he managed to do successfully.  He died about 1653.
</p>

<p>
To return to Orlando.  There are some
interesting entries in the College Records of 1601,
1602, and 1603, of sums of from 2s. to 2s. 6d. paid
to Gibbons&mdash;or Gibbins, as it is there spelt&mdash;for
music composed "<i>in festo Dominae Reginae</i>,"
and also in the two latter years for music
for the Purification.  No Christian name is given,
but there is little doubt it was Orlando Gibbons.
He was placed in an important and honourable
appointment at an early age, for in 1604 he
became Organist of the Chapel Royal, and in
1606 took his bachelor's degree at Cambridge.
</p>

<p>
In 1611 his name appears as an associate with
Byrd and Bull in a work called <i>Parthenia</i>, a
collection of pieces for the Virginals of which
I shall speak later on.
</p>

<p>
We do not hear much more of him until 1612,
with the exception of a mention in the State
Papers of that period, wherein we find a petition
in 1611 to the Earl of Salisbury "for a lease in
reversion of forty marks per annum of Duchy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
lands, without fine, as promised him by the
Queen."  The year 1612 sees the publication of
his <i>First sett of Madrigals and Mottets of</i> 5 <i>parts,
apt for viols or voyces</i>.  <i>Newly composed by
ORLANDO GIBBONS, Batchelor of Music,
Organist of H. M. Chapel in Ordinary</i>.  The work
is dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton, and the
dedication runs thus: "They were most of them
composed in your owne house and doe therefore
properly belong to you.  The language you
provided them, I only furnished them with tongues
to utter the same."  It is thought from this
that Sir C. Hatton wrote the words, as Gibbons
was on terms of close intimacy with him.
Another proof of this is shown by a piece in Ben
Coszyn's <i>Virginal Book</i>, where Gibbons is
represented by a "Hatten's" Galliard.  The
collection, <i>Madrigals and Mottets</i>, is rather
misleading as to title, for there is not one Motet in
it, though there are thirteen Madrigals, some
divided into 2, 3 and 4 sections, each as long as
an ordinary Madrigal.  One of the 'sett' is <i>The
Silver Swan</i>.
</p>

<p>
It has been stated that besides the published
Madrigals, no secular or vocal compositions
exist in MS. except a kind of <i>Burlesque
Madrigal</i> called <i>The Cryes of London for</i> 6 <i>voices</i>.
</p>

<p>
This statement is altogether incorrect.  To
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
mention one, a song, <i>A Soldier's Farewell to his
Mistress</i> ("My love, adieu") is in existence,
and I have often had it performed.  And the
statement about the <i>Burlesque Madrigal</i> is truly
absurd.  It is curious that the musical historians
have, as in Burney's case, either neglected to
notice the existence of the work on the Cryes
of London, or have, quite incorrectly, called it
a Madrigal.  It is a particularly interesting form
of composition.  Like Weelkes' <i>Humourous
Fancy</i>, it has parts for Viols and a superimposed
vocal score for S.A.T.B. (not 6 voices) consisting
of the Old Cryes of London.  But it differs in
one respect from Weelkes', for it is an "In
Nomine" for strings.  This is an older form of
the Fancy, and has the peculiarity of one part
for the Viol&mdash;an inner part&mdash;being allotted a
well-known old ecclesiastical melody.  This
Plainsong melody is to be found in the <i>Sarum
Missal</i> to the words "<i>Gloria Tibi Trinitas</i>,"
and, curiously enough, the same Plainsong is
used by many composers of "<i>In Nomines</i>,"
Byrd and Ferabosco amongst others.  But this
is the only example I have come across where a
sacred melody is introduced in connection with
secular, and, in the case of Cryes, somewhat
humourous words.  Examples of the introduction
of secular tunes into the sacred works by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
composers of the Italian school of the 16th
century are, of course, very common.  This is a
curious reversal of the custom, i.e. the
introduction of a sacred tune into a secular vocal
work.  It says much for Gibbons' skill that he
is able to write very effective and flowing Viol
parts and to introduce so many examples of the
old Cryes, quite untrammelled by the Plainsong
persistently played by one of the Viols.  The
copy from which this interesting work is taken
is a MS. written by Thomas Myriell in 1616, so
the Fancy was composed before that date.  The
copyist who preserved this work for us was the
Rector of St Stephen's, Wallbrook, the church
adjoining the Mansion House.  Between 1612
and 1622 must have been published the best
known Fantasies by Gibbons, for the collection
is dedicated to Edward Wray as one of the
Grooms of the Bedchamber, and Wray was
dismissed in 1622.  <i>Fantasies of Three parts
composed by Orlando Gibbons, Batchelor of Musick,
and late organist to His M. Chapel Royal in
Ordinary</i>.  Cut in Copper, the like not here-to-fore
Extant.  The word "late" is rather
surprising, when he is not recorded to have
resigned his position at the Chapel Royal.  He
was appointed Organist of Westminster Abbey
in 1623.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
</p>

<p>
These Fantasies were published by The
Musical Antiquarian Society in 1843; and in
some respects this publication has been the
cause of a good deal of ignorance as to the
real progress which Instrumental music made in
the early years of the 17th century.  They are
undoubtedly somewhat dull when placed by the
side of Fancies by Byrd and others.  No doubt
the veneration for Gibbons and the rightful
appreciation of his fine Cathedral music made
the members of the old and valuable Musical
Antiquarian Society more ready to edit his
Fancies than to select from less eminent
Church writers.  But one cannot have much
respect for Burney's judgment when he
pronounces Orlando Gibbons to have been "utterly
contemptible in his productions for
instruments."  He must be judged alongside of other
16th century composers; for, although he
indeed lived through the first quarter of the
<i>seventeenth</i> century, his instrumental music is
characteristic of the <i>sixteenth</i>.
</p>

<p>
In common with other composers of his day,
Gibbons shows in his Clavier works an earlier
and more successful attempt at a true
Instrumental style than he does in his music for
Strings.  The Viols were later in forsaking the
vocal polyphonic style than the keyed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
instruments, simply because the vocal style suited
the bowed instruments so much better than the
Clavier.  So we find composers for the Clavier
borrowing the rhythmic features of folk-songs
and dance-tunes much earlier than they found
it desirable or necessary to do in Viol music.
</p>

<p>
Out of six pieces by Gibbons in <i>Parthenia</i>,
three are dances (a Pavane and two Galliards);
one (<i>The Queenes Commande</i>) is an air with
variations; and the other two are the
<i>Preludium</i> (a piece of very simple harmonic design,
with florid figuration like the early organ
preludes) and a quite remarkable <i>Fantasia in four
parts</i>&mdash;remarkable because rather exceptional
as a Clavier piece, and also because of its
protracted and serious working in the Canzona style.
In the <i>Fitzwilliam Collection</i> the only pieces by
Gibbons are an air with variations, <i>The Woods
so Wilde</i>, and a Pavane&mdash;the latter, however,
being identical with <i>The Lord of Salisbury his
Pavin</i>, which is found also in <i>Parthenia</i>.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the Fancies written for "Base
Viall," "Mean Viall," and "Trebble Viall," after
the manner of the period, these were published
absolutely devoid of any indications of pace, of
phrasing, or of expression.  To this fact is
probably due some of their loss of popularity.
They require artists to interpret them, and in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
good hands are capable of considerable effect
in the old quaint style.  The robust tones of the
modern 'Cello, Viola and Violin can hardly give
us a correct impression of these pieces, but by
muting them a very good suggestion of "Viall"
tone is obtainable.
</p>

<p>
One may mention another "Fancy" written
this time for two "trebble Vialls" and a "Base."
Whether it is the difference of the instruments,
or the fact that it is a later number in the
collection and may therefore be a later
composition, I cannot say; but there is a distinctly
more modern spirit about this "Fancy."  It is
more rhythmic, the sections are more marked,
and at the end there is a complete repetition of an
eight-bar phrase, the only difference in the repeat
being that the first viall here takes the second
part, and <i>vice versa</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the domain of Sacred Music Orlando
Gibbons certainly holds the foremost place amongst
the English composers of the contrapuntal
school.  No name is better known in our
Cathedrals.  In great gatherings of Cathedral Choirs
in my young days (alas! we do not now have
such gatherings to any great extent) Gibbons'
splendid Service in F was always an item to
which we looked forward.  And he has left us
almost as great a collection of anthems as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
Purcell did in later years.  Many of them were
composed for special occasions.  One was a
wedding Anthem "for my Lord Somerset";
another "made for the King's being in
Scotland" (this was, of course, James I, and it was
from this Anthem I extracted the splendid
concluding "Amen" which was sung at the
Coronations of King Edward VII and King George V,
and which is now the recognized "Abbey Amen").
</p>

<p>
The Anthem "This is the record of John"
has a string accompaniment for Viols; this
was "made for Laud, President of St John's,
Oxford, for St John Baptist's Day."  Another
"Behold thou hast made my days" was
composed at the entreaty of Dr Maxey, Dean of
Windsor, "the same day se'night before his death."
</p>

<p>
Mention must also be made of "O clap your
hands," which has always had a suspicion
attached to it of having played the part of Dr
Heyther's Doctor's Exercise.  This suspicion is
deepened by the fact that Dr Cummings
possessed a MS. of it with the following inscription
upon it: "Dr Heyther's Commencement Song
Composed by Dr Orlando Gibbons".  They both
took their degrees at Oxford on the same
occasion viz: the foundation of the Camden History
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
Professorship.  Heyther was a Lay Vicar of
Westminster, and it was he who founded the
Oxford Music Lecture, now represented by the
Professorship.  It was originally worth £3 a
year.  The degrees were conferred on the two
friends of Camden at his special request.
</p>

<p>
Gibbons was also a contributor to Wither's
<i>Hymns and Songs of the Church</i>.  Withers
himself pays him the following tribute: "He hath
chosen to make his music agreeable to the matter,
and what the common apprehension can best
admit, rather than to the curious fancies of the
time; which path both of us could more easily
have trodden."
</p>

<p>
Gibbons appears to have had a sense of humour,
judging from a letter which we found in the
Westminster Abbey Muniment Room some years
ago.  I believe this is the only letter of Gibbons'
that is known.  It is addressed to the Treasurer
of the Abbey, asking that the organ-tuner, one
Burrard, might be paid; it runs as follows:
</p>

<p class="block">
Mr. Ireland: I know this bill to be very resonable
for I have alredy cut him off ten shillings therfore
I pray despathe him, for he hath delt honestly wth
ye church soe shall I rest yr servant,
</p>

<p class="block">
Orlando Gibbons.
</p>

<p>
The whole bill was very small, and by "cutting
him off ten shillings" I think old Orlando was
rather hard!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
</p>

<p>
We get a glimpse of Orlando Gibbons'
organ-playing in the Abbey from the <i>Life of
Archbishop Williams</i>, sometime Lord Keeper of the
Great Seal.  The French Ambassadors who
came over to arrange the marriage of the Prince
of Wales (afterwards Charles I) with Henrietta
Maria were entertained at supper in the Jerusalem
Chamber.  But before the Supper we are told
"The Embassadors, with the Nobles and
Gentlemen in their Company, were brought in at the
North Gate of the Abbey, which was stuck with
Flambeaux everywhere that strangers might
cast their eyes upon the stateliness of the Church.
At the Door of the Quire the Lord Keeper
besought their Lordships to go in and take their
seats there for a while.  At their entrance the
organ was touched by the best Finger of that
age, Mr Orlando Gibbons.  The Lord Embassadors
and their Great Train took up all the stalls
where they continued about half-an-hour, while
the Quiremen, vested in their Rich Copes, sang
three several Anthems with most exquisite
voices before them."
</p>

<p>
This Dean Williams was a very great man,
Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England,
Bishop of Lincoln, and afterwards Archbishop
of York; he was Dean of Westminster in 1620.
We are told in his <i>Life</i>, written by John Halket,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry: "He
procured the sweetest music both for the organ and
for voices of all parts, that ever was heard in
English music.  In those days the Abbey and
the Jerusalem Chamber, where he gave
entertainment to his friends, were the votaries of the
Choicest Songs that the Land has heard.  The
greatest masters of that delightful faculty
frequented here above all others."  I think it must
be to this patron of music that we owe the fine
collection of Madrigals and Motets (including the
very rare and valuable books of Deering) which
are now preserved in the Abbey Library.
</p>

<p>
This account of the perfection of the music
at the Abbey in these remote days, under the
fostering care of a Dean distinguished both as a
statesman and a musician, may perhaps be
followed by a contemporary description of the
members of a choir&mdash;not, of course, of the Abbey
Choir in particular by another Dean.  This
was Dean Earle, the first Dean after the
Restoration.  But the work from which I quote was first
printed in 1628, so that it is only a year or two
after the time of Gibbons.  Earle was not Dean
of Westminster until more than 30 years later.
The book is entitled <i>Microcosmographie: a piece
of the World discovered in Essays and
Characters</i>, and was first published anonymously.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
I hope this description of what the writer calls
"A Merry Crew, the Common Singing-men in
Cathedrall Churches," is not a true description
of the great body of such choirs at the time, but
it is worth quoting.
</p>

<p class="block">
<i>The Common Singing-men in Cathedral Churches</i>
</p>

<p class="block">
Are a bad Society, and yet a Company of good

recreation is prayers, their exercise drinking, yet
herein so religiously addicted that they serve God

before they read it, yet the old Hebrew names are
little beholden to them, for they mis-call them
worse then one another.  Though they never
expound the Scripture, they handle it much, and
pollute the Gospell with two things, their

behave themselves at Prayers as at their pots, for
they swallow them downe in an instant.  Their

Church a great deale better, and helpe to fill it with
their bones as before with their noyse.
</p>

<p>
This quotation must not be taken too seriously.
Earle's book was written when he was a young
man, probably under the inspiration of
Casaubon's translation of the fourth-century
Theophrastus' <i>Characters</i> published in 1592.  It
consists of 77 "Characters," some of them serious
studies, and others, such as the above, humorous
or satirical sketches, not intended to be true
representations, yet containing a basis of truth.
Richard Baxter, writing to Earle, says: "In
charity, and gentleness, and peaceableness of
mind, you are very eminent."
</p>

<p>
A very unusual adventure is chronicled as
having taken place on St Peter's Day, 1620:
"Eveseed, Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, did
violently and sodenly without cause runne upon
Mr Gibbons, took him up and threw him down
upon a Standard whereby he received such hurt
that he is not yet recovered of the same, and
withal he tare the band from his neck to his
prejudice and disgrace."
</p>

<p>
In 1625 Gibbons had to compose and direct the
music for the reception at Canterbury of Henrietta
Maria, on the occasion of her marriage with
Charles I.  It was to be his last commission, for
he died on Whitsunday, June 5th.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
</p>

<p>
With regard to his death, we have always been
led to believe that he died of small-pox&mdash;all the
histories, including the admirable Grove's
<i>Dictionary</i>, have taught us so.  Mr W. Barclay
Squire, of the British Museum, has, however,
shown this to be incorrect.  In a letter, which he
found among the State Papers, from Sir Albertus
Morton to Lord Edward Conway, and endorsed
"Mr Secretary Morton, touching the Musician
that dyed at Canterburie and supposed to have
died of the plague," a medical certificate is
enclosed signed by Drs Poe and Domingo, stating
that his sickness was at first "lethargicall"
followed by convulsions: "he grew apoplecticall
and so died"&mdash;thus refuting the small-pox
theory in favour of apoplexy.
</p>

<p>
His portrait is in the collection at Oxford,
and a fine monument with an excellent bust was
erected in Canterbury Cathedral by the
composer's widow.
</p>

<p>
It was my privilege to suggest and organize a
Musical Festival of Gibbons' works in
Westminster Abbey in 1907.  Some of his finest
Church music was given by a very large choir,
and a beautiful replica in black marble of the bust
of the composer, which is in Canterbury Cathedral,
was unveiled.  It has always seemed to me a
reflection upon the Abbey that no memorial to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
the greatest of its organists&mdash;save Purcell&mdash;should
be found there.  This Festival created very
great interest, and brought a munificent offer
from Mr Crews, a well-known amateur and
Master of the Worshipful Company of Musicians,
to defray the expense of a bust of the celebrated
organist.  It is well placed in close proximity
to the memorials of his worthy successors,
Blow, Purcell, and Croft.

<h3>
VI. RICHARD DEERING
</h3>

<h4>
1580 (?)&mdash;1630
</h4>

<p>
In considering the careers and works of the first
five musicians on my list of twelve, I have, it
is true, been treating of men whose names are
to be found in all musical histories.  But of the
next name on my list I am able to say I am on
comparatively new ground.  There is nothing so
surprising to me as the universal neglect&mdash;nay, I
may even use the word disdain&mdash;with which
musical historians of many periods have treated
the name of Richard Deering.  In common with
most people of my own age I knew very little
about this composer, and certainly in common
with, I venture to say, all my contemporaries,
I never heard a note of his music until a few
years ago.
</p>

<p>
The story of my awakening to the real merits
of this admirable composer is simple.  Looking
over the music in the Chapter Library at
Westminster, I found among many fine collections of
Madrigals&mdash;original copies, mostly published in
the 16th and early part of the 17th centuries&mdash;two
sets of Latin Motets in 5 and 6 parts by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
Richard Deering.  They were bound up in
covers made out of an illuminated MS.  On
looking at the bindings, our late Dean, Dr
Armitage Robinson (always interested in the
Library, and also, I may add, in my musical
researches) found that they were part of the
Wedding Service of the fourteenth century.
The binding was promptly taken off, the Deering
books rebound, and handed on to me.  I
proceeded to score some of the first book&mdash;published
in 1617&mdash;and had not done many bars before it
was plain I was indeed about to unearth a
treasure.  Full of beautiful Harmony and Contrapuntal
devices with examples of melodic progressions, new
and original, these works were speedily brought
to a hearing at my Gresham Lectures, and, with
as little delay as possible, edited (with English
translations), published, and introduced into
the Abbey Services.  Since then many Cathedrals
and great Churches have used them.  The Bach
Choir has performed some of them, and Deering's
fame has, I hope, been re-established!
</p>

<p>
I may say, before proceeding to give details of
Deering's career, that nearly a hundred years ago
an effort was made by a musical amateur to get
these Motets scored.  By a curious chance I have
come into the possession of letters which passed
between the owner of copies of these fine things
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
and Mr Sale of Westminster Abbey.  The owner
was the Rev Thomas Streatfeild, Vicar of Chart
Edge, a well-known Kentish antiquary, and he
came into possession&mdash;probably at a sale of some
of the old Deering books&mdash;of a set of parts of these
Motets.  He applied to Mr Sale (a very prominent
member of the musical profession, a Lay-Vicar
of Westminster Abbey and a principal singer at
the "Ancient Concerts") to get these Motets
scored for him.  A letter from Sale's daughter
apologizes for delay, and says "her father does
not think it will be worth while to go to any great
expense, as he has tried some parts of it (<i>i.e.</i> the
music of the Motets) with some who are used to
and admire that ancient style of music and they
do not form a very high opinion of it!"  Curiously
enough, a few bars in score of one of the
most beautiful Motets was enclosed with a note
from a copyist saying that it would take much
time and be very expensive.  So Deering's Motets
were laid to rest again for nearly 100 years.  I
may add Mr Sale was the music instructor to
Queen Victoria when she was a child.
</p>

<p>
Mr Streatfeild's copies of the 1617 Motets
(<i>uncut!</i>) were sold (at his death) by auction, and
fetched £4 16s. 0d.
</p>

<p>
The neglect of Deering is certainly extraordinary.
He was, as usual, absurdly criticized
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
by Dr Burney, who spoke of his music as "very
sober, innocent, psalmodic, dry, and
uninteresting," and further he "was never able to
discern in any of his works a single stroke of
genius, either in his melody or modulation."  And
Sir Frederick Ouseley actually writes of his
style as "severe and correct, but very dry"!
These verdicts amaze me!  They are absolutely
untrue, at least as regards Deering's great works,
his Motets.  I question if Burney or Ouseley ever
heard one of them.  They may have founded their
opinion upon some of his less important works,
published by Playford some 30 or 40 years after
Deering's death, which Playford himself does not
vouch for as being certainly by Deering.  And, as
regards Deering's Fancies, I can hardly believe
either Burney or Ouseley had any real
knowledge of them, for one which I produced at a
University Lecture in 1912 was of a high order
of merit.
</p>

<p>
That Deering was appreciated at his proper
value by his contemporaries is apparent from
the way in which Peacham, in his <i>Compleat
Gentleman</i> (1622) couples his name with others
"for depth of skill and quickness of concept."  Almost
the only bit of information which historians
tell us is that "Cromwell was very fond
of his music," and that John Kingston, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
organist, with two of his boys, often sang
Deering's music to the Protector.  The mention of
"two boys" points to the Two-part Motets as
being the music performed&mdash;not, of course, to
the Motets for five or six voices.  Mace in
his <i>Musick's Monument</i> (1676) mentions Deering's
<i>Gloria Patri</i> and other of his Latin settings.
</p>

<p>
I must now turn to the personal history of this
good musician.
</p>

<p>
Richard Deering was descended from an
ancient family&mdash;the Deerings of the County of
Kent.  The branch from which Richard Deering
traces his descent was the one headed by
William Deering of Petworth, in co. Sussex, and
his wife, Eleanor Dyke.  The Deering of this
sketch was the son of Henry Deering of Liss,
near Petworth, by the Lady Elizabeth Grey.
He died in 1630.
</p>

<p>
It is stated by Anthony Wood that Deering was
"bred up in Italy, where he obtained the name
of a most admirable musician.  After his return
he practised his Faculty for some time in England,
where his name being highly cried up, became
after many entreaties, Organist to the English
Nuns living at Brussels."  It is not easy to
discover anything about Deering's Italian life or
work.  My friend, the Rev Dr Spooner Lillingston,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
made some Inquiries for me in Italy, and is
kind enough to write as follows:
</p>

<p>
"The Earl of Kent's family (of which Deering's
mother was a member) remained Catholic for
many years, and this family, half a century
before, seem to have intermarried with certain of
the Italian nobility.  Lady Elizabeth Grey does
not appear in any record of the Greys of Kent.
May not Deering's mother have been of Italian
extraction?  Hence his Catholic religion and
Italian training."
</p>

<p>
As to his Italian sojourn Dr Spooner Lillingston
continues: "There is no record of his first
Communion at St John Lateran, so probably he
did not go to Italy until about ten years of age,
all such records of First Communions made in
Italy being registered at St John's Lateran."  Dr
Lillingston also tells us there is a record of an
8-part Motet by Deering having been performed
in one of the Churches, the title being <i>O quam
Gloriosa</i>.
</p>

<p>
That Deering studied hard and composed while
in Italy seems pretty certain.  Judged from an
observation in his "Dedication" of the 1617
Motets it would appear that it was in Rome that
he wrote them.  In this dedication he speaks of
having composed them in the chief city of the
world.  I cannot help thinking that "the chief
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
city of the world" to Deering&mdash;a Catholic&mdash;was Rome.
</p>

<p>
Almost the first fact of which we have very
certain knowledge in connection with his life in
England is the "Supplication" which he made
for the degree of Bachelor of Music at Oxford, in
April, 1610.  In answer to an inquiry, the Keeper
of the Archives said that there is a record of
Deering's supplication, and it is stated that his
plea is granted "providing he shall have
composed a work of eight parts for the next
'Act.'"  Dr Scott, the learned custodian of our Abbey
Muniments for many years, made some inquiries
for me on this matter, and gives the following
note which he had apparently received from
Oxford:
</p>

<p class="block">
"Supplicateth in like manner Richard Deering,
a scholar most highly trained in music, of Christ
Church, forasmuch as he hath spent ten years in
the study and practise of music, that this may
suffice for him to be admitted to the lectures of the
music of Boethius."
</p>

<p>
The statement by Deering that he had spent
"ten years in the study and practise of
music" absolutely disposes of the legend, so often
repeated, that Deering published a set of 5-part
Motets in Antwerp, in 1597.  I have always
entirely doubted that this had any foundation in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
fact.  I believe it is a misprint for 1617, and it
was not likely twenty years would elapse between
the publication of two sets of Motets by so prolific
a composer.  "Ten years" makes the date of
Deering's <i>studies</i> to begin in 1600, so he could not
have published in 1597.  I am glad to be able to
correct this error on the authority of the Master
himself.
</p>

<p>
It is very amusing, and rather annoying, to see
how the musical historians have copied from one
another the most untrue statements about
Deering.  Burney, Hawkins, and Mr Husk in the first
edition of Grove's <i>Dictionary</i>, <i>all</i> give 1597
instead of 1617; and Burney and Hawkins say
he was forced to leave England when the troubles
of Charles I began.  Hawkins says he was Organist
to Henrietta Maria until <i>she</i> was compelled to
leave England.  The fact is Deering was dead
before all this!  He returned to England as
Organist to Henrietta Maria in 1625, and died
in 1630.
</p>

<p>
But space would fail me to point out more of
the absurd statements about this musician.  Let
me rather now turn to his greatest contribution to
our musical treasures.
</p>

<p>
I leave for a time further comment upon his
work in England, and proceed to consider his
magnificent Motets.  It appears that on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
invitation of the English nuns at Brussels he
proceeded to that city and became Organist to
the Convent.  It was whilst there that he
published in 1617 his fine series of <i>Cantiones Sacrae</i>
for five voices; this was issued from the press of
Peter Phalese in Antwerp.  There are 18 Motets,
all to Latin words, for five voices, and "Basso
Continuo" for Organ.
</p>

<p>
I have already spoken of the way I made
acquaintance with these masterpieces.  It is very
gratifying to find the increased favour with
which they are received and the frequent
performance of them by great choirs.  The ignorant
accounts of them which I have quoted shake
one's faith in the opinion of such writers on other
musical works.
</p>

<p>
The first set of Motets was dedicated to a
remarkable personage, Sir William Stanley,[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
the Preface is so interesting I feel justified in
giving it (with the title-page).  The original
Dedication is in Latin, but I give it in a translation.[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
</p>

<p>
In the second set, published in 1618, Deering
claims to have written in the Madrigalian style.
It looks as if he had tried to imitate the Madrigals
he had heard, and to adapt some of the phrases
to sacred words.  I do not think the second set
is as good as the first.  But there are some very
fine things in it, one of the best being "Silence
prevailed in Heaven," a dramatic account of St
Michael's war with the Dragon.  I have had this
printed, and it produces a splendid effect, and
hope in time to restore to life many more of
these unknown and really beautiful masterpieces.
</p>

<p>
I have not space to chronicle all Deering's
musical works.  But I must conclude this notice
by some account of his secular music, and, more
particularly, his remarkable <i>Humorous Fancy,
The Crycs of London</i>.  This is the third of these
interesting Fancies which I have had the
opportunity of recovering from oblivion.  I have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
already in the case of Weelkes and Gibbons
explained the circumstances attending this recovery.
Deering's <i>Fancy</i> is the most elaborate of the
three, and, besides a number of <i>Cryes</i> which the
other musicians omitted, he has preserved to us
some most interesting and charming Tradesmen's
Songs&mdash;those of the Swepe, the Blacking-seller,
the Vendor of Garlick, the Rat-catcher, and the
Tooth-drawer.  The whole <i>Fancy</i> is full of life,
and shows Deering to be both dramatic and
humourous.  This work (and a similar one on
<i>Country Cryes</i>) were written before he left
England for Brussels, as the copy in the British
Museum was made 1616.
</p>

<p>
There are a few Anthems scattered about in
various Libraries, but as a Catholic his contributions
to English Cathedral music would, no doubt,
be few.  Some are to be found in Durham
Cathedral Library.  On the marriage of Charles I, he
was appointed Organist to the Queen Henrietta
Maria.  On July 11th, 1628, his name appears
in a list of musicians in ordinary to the King,
and he was evidently a member of the King's
Private Band.
</p>

<p>
Most historians have stated that he lived to
1657, but this is just as incorrect as their other
statements concerning Deering and his music.
I have devoted much time to the elucidation of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
the history and the reproduction of his work, and
feel in doing this I have helped to restore to
his rightful place one of the greatest English
musicians of the 17th, or indeed of any, century.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>] Sir William Stanley was a Roman Catholic and a very
extraordinary man.  I think the following account from the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> will be of interest.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
Sir W. Stanley, Adventurer, one of the Cheshire Stanleys.
He served in the Netherlands under Alva.  He quitted the
Spanish service in 1570 and served in Ireland under
Elizabeth, and later on was appointed Sheriff of Cork.  He was
very severe on the rebels and he reported he had hanged
300 of them and so terrified the rest that "a man might
now travel the whole country and no one molest him."  He
thought he was not properly rewarded, and later on was
guilty of treachery.  He was, of course, Roman Catholic
and greatly in the confidence of the Jesuits.  He actually
went to Spain to advise the best method of conquering
England.  He recommended that Ireland should be made the
basis of operations, and that troops should disembark at
Milford Haven rather than at Portsmouth.  When Elizabeth
died Stanley sent no less a person than Guy Fawkes, his
subaltern officer, with an emissary of Catesby to Spain, to
warn Philip against James.  There is no evidence that he
was concerned in the Gunpowder Plot, but he was placed
under arrest at Brussels on suspicion of being concerned in it.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
He spent the latter part of his life in complete obscurity.
In 1616 he contributed largely to a Jesuit College of Liége,
and was Governor of Mechlin.  He sought in vain for
permission to return to England, and died at Ghent in 1630,
and was honoured with a magnificent public funeral.  He
married Elizabeth, daughter of John Egerton of Egerton,
who was buried in Mechlin Cathedral, in 1614.  The male line
of the Stanleys of Horton became extinct by the death of the
twelfth baronet Sir John Stanley-Errington in 1883.

<h3>
VII. JOHN MILTON
</h3>

<h4>
1553&mdash;1646-7
</h4>

<p>
To many the name of John Milton will hardly
suggest a musical composer.  And yet I am able
to include this name&mdash;the name of the father of
the poet&mdash;among the band of "Good Musicians"
whose careers and works I am considering.  I
have always felt greatly interested in him and
desired to find out all I could of his personal
history, and particularly of his musical
education, for undoubtedly in the elder Milton we have
a really accomplished musician.  We are told he
educated his distinguished son in music, and that
he had an organ in his house.
</p>

<p>
Dr Burney gives a very good and concise
account of him, upon which I cannot improve
and from which I venture to quote.  (Burney,
Vol. III, p. 134):
</p>

<p>
"We come now to John Milton, the father of
our great poet, who though a scrivener by
profession, was a voluminous composer, and equal in
science, if not genius, to the best musicians of his
age: in conjunction and on a level with whom,
his name and works appeared in numerous musical
publications of the time, particularly in those of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
old Wilbye; in the <i>Triumphs of Oriana</i> published
by Morley; in Ravenscroft's <i>Psalms</i>; in the
<i>Lamentations</i> published by Sir William Leighton;
and in MS. collections, still in the possession of
the curious.
</p>

<p>
Mr Warton, in his Notes upon Milton's <i>Poems
on Several Occasions</i>, tells us, from the MS. <i>Life
of the Poet</i> by Aubrey, the antiquary, in the
Mus. Ashm. Oxon, that Milton's father, though
a "scrivener," was not apprenticed to that
trade, having been bred a scholar and of Christ
Church, Oxford; and that he took to trade in
consequence of being disinherited.
</p>

<p>
His son celebrates his musical abilities in an
admirable Latin poem, <i>Ad Patrem</i>, where, alluding
to his father's musical science, he says that
Apollo had divided his favours in the sister arts
between them; giving Music to the father and
Poetry to the son.
</p>

<p class="poem">
Nor blame, Oh much-lov'd sire! the sacred Nine,<br />
Who thee have honour'd with such gifts divine;<br />
Who taught thee how to charm the list'ning throng,<br />
With all the sweetness of a siren's song;<br />
Blending such tones as every breast inflame<br />
And made thee heir to great Orion's fame.<br />
By blood united, and by kindred arts,<br />
On each Apollo his refulgence darts:<br />
To thee points out the magic power of sound,<br />
To me the mazes of poetic ground;<br />
And fostered thus by his parental care,<br />
We equal seem Divinity to share."  (<i>Translation</i>).<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
</p>

<p>
The elder Milton was born in 1553, and is said
to have been in the choir of Christ Church,
Oxford.  His father was a Roman Catholic, and
it is said he disinherited his son for abjuring the
Catholic faith.  The son went to London, and
became a member of the Scriveners Company
(1599-1600).  In 1632 he retired to Horton, in
Buckinghamshire, having made a considerable
fortune.  In London he lived in Bread Street,
where John Milton, the poet, was born.  He
contributed an admirable six-part Madrigal to
<i>The Triumphs of Oriana</i> (1601), Motets to
Leighton's <i>Teares and Lamentations</i> (1614), and Tunes
to Ravenscroft's <i>Psalter</i> (1621).  There are
various Anthems and Fancies in five and six parts in
MS. in various libraries.
</p>

<p>
Now here is a man who contributed to three
or four important musical publications, and was
included in a list of the best known
English composers.  Had he been a professional
musician he could not have done more.  But we
know he was a scrivener.  What was he before
he became a scrivener? and whence did he get his
musical knowledge?  If we could prove that the
suggestion is true which makes him a Chorister at
Christ Church, Oxford, we should know where
he probably got his musical knowledge and
his proficiency in Latin.  But this information
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
seems to be impossible of proof.  For the purpose
of these Lectures I have devoted a good deal of
time to this subject.  Dr Strong, the Dean of
Christ Church, now Bishop of Ripon, has been
kind enough to look into the matter very
carefully, and he writes me the following interesting
letter:
</p>

<p class="block">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxford.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 25, 1919.<br />
</p>

<p class="block">
My dear Bridge,
</p>

<p class="block">
I am sorry to say that I cannot discover
anything about Mr. John Milton, Senior.  We have
here a very important series of books called
Disbursement books.  These contain a sort of
summary statement of the payments made under
various heads.  But what makes them of interest
is that all the members of the Foundation, from
the Dean down to the cook, received their payments
through the Treasurer and signed a receipt for them
in the book.  So there is a whole list of signatures
beginning about 1570 and going down (with the
exception of the Civil War period) to about 1830,
when new methods were adopted.  It is always
possible to discover by this who held each office,
and whether they were in residence on a particular
day.  Unfortunately, they do not go back beyond
1570.  I searched through a volume in hopes that
Mr. Milton or the organist might be among the
signatories.  The singing-men and even the
choristers are there.  But apparently at that time there
was no organist, and certainly there is no allusion
to Milton or any names such as you want, I think.
It is a great pity we have not got the books from the
beginning: the first 23 years would have been very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
useful.  Also, my matriculation book, which is in
this house, is very inaccurate and incomplete for
the earlier years.  I am afraid, therefore, I cannot
help you as regards Mr. Milton.  You will
understand how very interesting these signatures are
when I say that in the volumes I looked at the
other day I found a whole series of signatures of
Richard Hakluyt the geographer, who was a student
of the House.

It is very unfortunate that the records in
Christ Church do not exist before 1570.  But it
may be remarked, if Milton the elder was born in
1553, he would be seventeen in 1570, and would
therefore certainly have left the choir of Christ
Church, if he ever belonged to it; and this, of
course, before the entries began.  As to this
matter, there are one or two facts brought out in
<i>Notes and Queries</i> some years since which bear
upon it.
</p>

<p>
Richard Milton, the grandfather of the poet,
although a Roman Catholic, appears to have been
Churchwarden of the Parish (Stanton St John)
in 1552.  Mr Allnutt, of Oxford, who contributed
this bit of historical knowledge, writes: "Does
this render it less probable that the Poet's
grandfather was Richard Milton of Stanton, or are
other instances known of Roman Catholics
serving the office of Churchwarden under the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
Protestant regime of the period?" (<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>,
Feby. 1880; W. H. Allnutt, Oxford.)
</p>

<p>
In the same paper, a little later, Mr Hyde
Clarke writes on the subject of Milton's father
being a choir-boy at Christ Church: "My Oxford
and other correspondents, including Mr Mark
Pattison, the eloquent critic of the Poet, who has
laboured in this investigation have looked
unfavourably on my proposition (<i>i.e.</i> that he was a
Chorister of Christ Church), because they
consider the Roman Catholic <i>recusant</i> can never have
sent his son to any heretical school.  An answer
is now given in my favour by Mr. Allnutt, because
if in 1552 Richard Milton could serve as
Churchwarden, the other matter of providing a
scholarship for his son was but a small one.  It is
further probable that Richard Milton became a
confirmed Roman Catholic only in his later
years."&mdash;Hyde Clarke.
</p>

<p>
I think it is quite possible and even very
probable that Milton's father learnt his music at
Christ Church.  Then who taught him?
Whoever it was, he turned out a thoroughly good
musician.  Milton's own compositions prove it,
and, as we have seen, he is associated with all the
best English composers of the period in more than
one work.  Coming to London, we are told he had
an organ and other instruments in his house and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
to the practice of music he devoted his leisure.
Masson says: "His special faculty was music,
and it is possible on his first coming to London
he had taught or practised music professionally."  He
was evidently in the musical world of London,
and his house was probably the resort of many of
the best musicians of the time.
</p>

<p>
The short Motet for <i>Teares and Lamentations</i> is
in a good contrapuntal style, with many devices
which a man would use if he had been educated
in a Cathedral Choir.  The style had "eaten into
his marrow," as old Sir John Goss once said to
me, in reference to a Chorister's daily musical work.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting matter is Milton's
contribution to Ravenscroft's <i>Whole Book of Psalms</i>,
published in 1621.  Here are found two tunes
credited to John Milton, but I think there is no
doubt they were merely harmonized by him.
The best one is a tune still often sung in our
Churches&mdash;entitled <i>York</i>: this seems to be an
old Scottish tune; it was published in
Edinburgh in 1615.  It appears three times in
Ravenscroft's book and with different harmonies, two of
them being by the elder Milton.  The melody in
this tune is, of course, given to the tenor, as was
the custom at this time.  The tune has always
been a favourite, and an old author says that "it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
was so well known that half the nurses in England
used to sing the tenor part as a lullaby."
</p>

<p>
This sounds rather startling!  One would not
believe that any baby could be put to sleep by
hearing the tenor part of any hymn-tune.  But
the tenor part here is the melody, and really it has
a gentle, swaying style about it, so that I, for one,
believe the story of the Nurses and the Babies!
</p>

<p>
The melody is given in <i>English Country Songs</i>
edited by Miss Broadwood and Mr Fuller
Maitland, allied to some amusing words.
</p>

<p>
Although we cannot claim the elder Milton as
a musician who did much to advance the art, I
think I may be forgiven for having included his
name in my list.  So little is said about him in
musical histories, and I have been able, I think,
to get together some comparatively unknown
matter regarding him, that I hope I have done
right in giving a place among my Twelve Good
Musicians to John Milton the elder.

<h3>
VIII. HENRY LAWES
</h3>

<h4>
1595&mdash;1662
</h4>

<p>
In Henry Lawes we have a subject of particular
interest.  No musician of the 17th or probably
of any century, has been so praised by the
poets, and few musicians of reputation have
been so disdainfully treated by the old musical
historians.  I think we shall find Henry Lawes
worthy of inclusion amongst the Twelve Good
Musicians with whom I am dealing.  His life
was a chequered one.  He lived in troublous
days, and in an era of great changes in the
political and musical worlds.  Born in 1595,
at Dinton, in Wiltshire, he became a pupil
of Giovanni Coperario (or John Cooper, to give
him his English name), and I think this had a
considerable influence on the direction which his
compositions took, and about which I shall say
more later.  We find him a Gentleman of the
Chapel Royal in 1625, and later on a Gentleman
of the Private Music to King Charles the First.
On the breaking out of the Rebellion, he lost his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
posts, and employed himself principally in
teaching singing.  He lived a long life; long enough
to see the Restoration, and to compose the
Coronation Anthem for King Charles the Second, dying
in 1662.
</p>

<p>
Lawes' contributions to English music begin
with the Masque.  The earliest date seems to be
1633-4, when he set the songs in a Masque written
by Thomas Carew, entitled <i>Coelum Britannicum</i>.
This was written at the particular invitation of
the King, and performed for the first time at
Whitehall.
</p>

<p>
The poem was published in 1634 and was
wrongly attributed to Sir William Davenant.
Another Masque, by James Shirley, <i>The Triumph
of Peace</i>, was produced in the same year, Lawes
and another well-known musician, Simon Ives,
writing the music, for which they received the
sum of £100.  The following year saw the
production of <i>Comus</i>, the greatest of Masques.  It
will be seen that Lawes differed from most of our
English Composers in devoting himself, at the
outset of his career, almost exclusively to the
stage.  I cannot help thinking this is to be
explained by the fact that he was not educated
in a Cathedral Choir, but was a pupil of Giovanni
Coperario.  Now this musician had an experience
which few of his contemporaries enjoyed.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
studied in Italy&mdash;going there as plain John
Cooper and returning to his native country as
Giovanni Coperario.  His sojourn in Italy was
at a remarkable time; the time when the first
Opera and the first Oratorio were given.  It is
very interesting to be told&mdash;and I have been told
on the authority of my friend Rev. Spooner
Lillingston&mdash;that among the names given in a
certain record of the performance of the first
Opera was found that of the Englishman,
Giovanni Coperario.  This seems to me to be an
important fact.  Lawes would come under the
influence of Coperario, who, with his love for
Italian music and experience of the beginning
of Opera would, no doubt, help Lawes to take
up the music of the stage, instead of the music
of the Church.
</p>

<p>
Our composer was not, however, long before
he embarked on some Church music by setting
<i>A Paraphrase upon the Psalms of David</i> by
George Sandys, and also contributing another
volume of tunes to <i>Church Psalms</i>, in which
he was joined by his clever brother William,
who was, later on, killed at the siege of Chester.
</p>

<p>
Among the commendatory poems prefixed to
this volume was the well-known sonnet by
Milton addressed to Lawes, beginning:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
Harry, whose tuneful and well measured Song<br />
First taught our English musick how to span<br />
Words with just note and accent&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>
He was a prolific writer of songs and Masque-music,
but his great opportunity was in writing
the music and producing Milton's <i>Masque of
Comus</i>, at Ludlow, in 1634.  Milton was a
friend, and I think there is no doubt a pupil in
music of Lawes.  Milton's father had much
music in his house in Bread Street, and no doubt,
Lawes was among the eminent musicians who
gathered there.  When Milton's father removed
to Horton, in Buckinghamshire, we are told that
the young Milton came up to London to receive
instruction in music, as well as in other things.
It was Lawes who apparently got Milton to
write the Masque, which he desired to produce at
Ludlow Castle in September 1634.  The story of
Comus and its origin is so well known that I need
not dwell upon it.  The music of the Masque
was not published in the composer's life-time,
but, curiously enough, it was Lawes who edited
Milton's Poem in 1637.  This was published
without the name of the poet appearing[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>], and was
dedicated to Viscount Brackly, one of those who
took part in the performance at Ludlow.  In the
dedication Lawes says: "Although not openly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
acknowledged by the Author, yet it is legitimate
offspring, so lovely, and so much to be desired,
that the often copying of it hath tired my pen
to give my several friends satisfaction, and
brought me to the necessity of producing it to
the public view."
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately we have only five songs of the
original music.  There are a great number of
places in the Masque for which Milton desires
music&mdash;and many directions for instrumental
movements particularly.  What these were we
do not know.  The merits of Lawes' music have
been decried, but having edited the <i>Comus</i>
music, after careful correction from Lawes'
original MS., which I was fortunate enough to be
able to see[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>], I am confident that all who hear
it will find the songs full of beauty and
expression, and well worthy of the words to which
they were so admirably fitted.
</p>

<p>
I must not dwell longer upon <i>Comus</i>, for there
is much to be said about Lawes' other work.
</p>

<p>
Playford was a great patron and admirer of
Lawes.  He published no fewer than three
books of <i>Ayres and Dialogues</i>, which contain
some charming settings of excellent poetry.
The first book of <i>Ayres</i> was dedicated to his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
pupils, Lady Alice Egerton and her sister,
daughters of Lord Bridgwater, and in it he says:
"No sooner had I thought of making these
public than I resolved upon inscribing them to your
Ladyships; most of them being composed when
I was employed by your ever honoured Parents
to attend your Ladyships' education in music."
</p>

<p>
Lawes is often said to have "introduced the
Italian style of music into this kingdom," but
this is hardly correct.  That he admired and
understood the Italian style is quite certain.
His studies with Coperario would have influenced
him in that direction, and he himself, in one of
his numerous Prefaces (and he was a great writer
of Prefaces), speaks of the Italians as being
great masters of music, but at the same time he
contends "that our own nation has produced
as many able musicians as any in Europe."  He
laughs at the partiality of the age for songs
sung in a foreign language.  In one of the
prefaces to his <i>Book of Ayres</i> he says: "This present
generation is so sated with what's native, that
nothing takes their ears but what's sung in a
Language which (commonly) they understand
as little as they do the music.  And to make them
a little sensible of this ridiculous humour I took
a Table or Index of old Italian Songs (for one,
two, and three voyces), and this Index (which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
read together made a strange medley of
nonsense) I set to a varyed Ayre, and gave out that it
came from Italy, whereby it hath passed for a
<i>rare Italian song</i>.  This very song I have since
printed."
</p>

<p>
This shows him a real humorist, and it is,
I should suppose, the first real Comic Song!
It is set quite in the style of an Italian song, with
much declamation and with some charming
melodious phrases.  I have often had it performed
at my Lectures, and when sung in Italian it is
listened to very stolidly, but when the English
translation is given it creates much hilarity.  I
give the English translation, whereby it will be
seen it is indeed "a strange medley of nonsense."
</p>

<p>
The title is given in Lawes' book as <i>Tavola</i>
(i.e. a Table or Index):
</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>Tavola.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
In that frozen heart .... (for one voice)<br />
Weep, my lady, weep, and if your eyes .... (for two voices)<br />
'Tis ever thus, ev'n when you seem to sive me,<br />
Truly you scorn me.<br />
Unhappy, unbelieving,<br />
Alas! of splendour yet!<br />
But why, oh why? from the pallid lips<br />
And so my life .... (for three voices).<br />
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt Lawes was a well-educated
man, and it was certainly one of the reasons
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
why he set words with "just note and accent,"
and obtained the great praise of so many
contemporary poets.  It is said he never set bad
poetry[<a id="chap08fn3text"></a><a href="#chap08fn3">3</a>]; and he set songs to Italian, to Spanish,
and even to Greek words.  An interesting fact
in connection with his love for good poetry is
given in J. P. Collier's <i>Catalogue of Early
English Literature in the Bridgwater House Library</i>,
1837.  Amongst the books catalogued is a
volume of poems by Francis Beaumont, which
was presented to the Earl of Bridgwater by
Henry Lawes.  The following inscription is
found fastened to the cover:
</p>

<p class="block">
For the Right Honble. John, Earl of Bridgwater,
my most honoured Lord, from his Lordship's most
humble servant
</p>

<p class="block">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Lawes.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The Earl of Bridgwater is the Nobleman for
whom <i>Comus</i> was produced.
</p>

<p>
Lawes was a real champion of English music
and English musicians, and certainly understood
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
what he was writing about.  Although somewhat
lengthy, I really cannot refrain from giving
the Preface to one of his <i>Books of Ayres</i>, which
goes into this subject.  It is both amusing and
improving, and deserves to be read by all.
</p>

<p class="block">
To all Understanders or Lovers of Musick.
</p>

<p class="block">
In my former you saw what temptations I had to
publish my Compositions: and now I had not
repeated that Error (if it prove to be one) but upon
the same grounds, back'd with a promise I made
to the World.
</p>

<p class="block">
Though the civill Reception my last Book found
were sufficient invitation, for which I gladly here
offer my Thanks, especially to those worthy and
grateful Strangers, who are far more candid and
equall in their Censures than some new Judges of
our own Country, who (in spite of their starrs) will
sit and pronounce upon things they understand not.
</p>

<p class="block">
But this is the Fate of all mankind, to be
render'd less at home than abroad.  For my part I
can say (and there are will believe me) that if any
man have low thoughts of mee, hee is of my opinion.
Yet the way of Composition I chiefly possess (which
is to shape Notes to the Words and Sense) is not
hit by too many: and I have been often sad to
observe some (otherwise able Musicians) guilty of
such Lapses and mistakes this way.  And possibly
this is it makes many of us hear so ill abroad; which
works a Beleefe amongst ourselves, that English
words will not run well in Musick: This I have said,
and must ever avow, is one of the Errors of this
Generation.
</p>

<p class="block">
I confess I could wish that some of our words
could spare a Consonant (which must not be slur'd,
for fear of removing those Landmarks in spelling
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
which tell their Originall); but those are very few,
and seldom occur; and when they do, are
manageable enough by giving each syllable its particular
humour; provided the breath of the sense be
observed.  And (I speak it freely once for all) that
if English words which are fitted for song do not
run smooth enough 'tis the fault either of the
Composer or Singer.
</p>

<p class="block">
Our English is so stor'd with plenty of Monosyllables
(which, like small stones, fill up the chinks)
that it hath great priviledge over divers of its
neighbours, and in some particulars (with reverence
be it spoken) above the very Latin, which Language
we find overcharg'd with the letter (S) especially in
(bus) and such hissing Terminations.  But our new
Criticks lodge not the fault in our words only;
'tis the Artist they tax as a man unspirited for
forraign delights: which vanity so spreads, that
those our productions they please to like must
be born beyond the Alpes, and father'd upon
Strangers.  And this is so notorious, that not long
since some young Gentlemen, who were not
untravell'd, hearing some Songs I had set to Italian
words (publickly sung by excellent voyces)
concluded those songs were begotten in Italy, and said
(too loud) "they would faine heare such songs to
be made by an Englishman."  Had they layd their
sceane a little nearer home, there had been more
colour; for, a short Ayre of mine (neare 20 years
old) was lately reviv'd in our neighbour Nation, and
publickly sung to words of their own as a new
borne piece, without alteration of any one Note:
Tis the Ayre to those words, "Old Poets Hippocrene
admire etc." a sorry trifle (a man would think)
to be rais'd from the dead after 18 years burial.
But (to meet with this humour of lusting after
Novelties) a friend of mine told some of that
company, that a rare new Book was come from Italy,
which taught the reason why an Eighth was the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
sweetest of all notes in Musick; because (said he)
Jubal who was Founder of Musick was the eighth
man from Adam; and this went down as current
as my songs came from Italy.  I beg your pardon
for instancing such particulars.  But there are
knowing persons, who have been long bred in those
worthily admired parts of Europe, who ascribe more
to us than we to ourselves; and able Musicians
returning from Travaill doe wonder to see us so
thirsty after Forraigners.
</p>

<p class="block">
For they can tell us (if we knew it not) that
Musick is the same in England as in Italy; the
Concords and Discords, the Passions, Spirits,
Majesty and Humours, are all the same they are in
England; their manner of composing is sufficiently
known to us, their best Compositions being brought
over hither by those who are able enough to choose.
</p>

<p class="block">
But we must not here expect to find Music at
the highest, when all Arts and Sciences are at so
low an ebbe.  As for myself, although I have lost
my Fortunes with my Master (of ever blessed
Memory) I am not so low to bow for a subsistence
to the follies of this Age; and to humour such as
wil seem to understand our Art, better than we
that have spent our lives in it.

If anything here bring you benefit or delight, I

This is in the Second Book of <i>Ayres and Dialogues.
Dedicated to the Hon. the Lady Dering, wife
to Sir Edward Dering, Bart</i>.
</p>

<p>
During the Civil War he appears to have lived
in London, composing and teaching.  His
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
compositions for the Church in the way of Anthems
were but few.  As we have seen in his early
days, he preferred the stage, and during the
Commonwealth there was no inducement to
write Cathedral music.  But the words of
several of his Anthems are to be found in
Clifford's <i>Divine Services and Anthems</i>, published
in 1666.
</p>

<p>
In 1656 he joined Captain Cooke and others
in writing music for Davenant's <i>First Day's
Entertainment at Rutland House</i>, e.g., declamation
and music.  A little later he assisted in the
production of <i>The Siege of Rhodes</i>, which Roger
North calls a semi-opera.
</p>

<p>
This was produced during the Commonwealth,
and is of particular interest from the fact that
Purcell's father, Henry Purcell the elder, took
part in the performance.  This is the first notice
we get of the Purcell family, about whom I hope
to say more in a later Lecture.  It is an
interesting fact that the composer of the music to the
last important Masque (Milton's <i>Comus</i>) should
have helped also in what was apparently the
first English Opera.[<a id="chap08fn4text"></a><a href="#chap08fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
Lawes at the Restoration was re-appointed
to his Chapel Royal post, and composed the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
Anthem <i>Zadok the Priest</i> for the Coronation of
Charles II.  He did not long survive the revival
of his fortunes.  He lived in the little Almonry
at Westminster, the block of ancient buildings
in which the Purcell family lived.  He probably
knew the young Henry Purcell, then a child of
tender years, and one wonders if he detected
the musical genius of the little boy.
</p>

<p>
We get a glimpse of him in his last days from
the <i>Diary</i> of Samuel Pepys, who, on December
30th, 1660, makes the following entry:
</p>

<p class="block">
Mr. Child and I spent some time at the Lute, and
so promising to prick me some lessons to my theorbo
he went away to see Henry Lawes who lies very
sick....  I to the Abbey, and walked there,
seeing the great companies of people that come
there to hear the organs.
</p>

<p>
The Coronation was in April, 1661, so Lawes
recovered from his illness, though he died the
following year.  He was buried in the Cloisters
of Westminster Abbey though unfortunately
there is nothing to mark the spot of his
interment.  I think it is probably in the "Little
Cloister" as Dr Wilson, a brother musician,
was interred there a few years later.
</p>

<p>
In Henry and William Lawes we have "two
noble brothers" who deserve to be remembered
with affectionate respect.  The portraits of both
are preserved at Oxford.

IX. MATTHEW LOCKE
</h3>

<h4>
1630 (?)&mdash;1677
</h4>

<p>
A prominent personage in the seventeenth-century
musical world was Matthew Locke.
The exact date of his birth is not known, but it
was approximately 1630.  Matthew Locke laid
the foundation of his art as a chorister in an
English Cathedral, and at Exeter there is
evidence that he occupied that position in 1638.
The evidence cannot be disputed, as it is graven
in the very fabric of the old Cathedral.  The
embryo musician took the trouble, upon two
occasions, to inscribe his name upon the walls of
the Cathedral, together with the dates.  Upon
the inner side of the old organ screen runs the
legend "Matthew Lock, 1638," and in a more
abbreviated form at a later date "M. L., 1641."
As a boy he seems to have been content with a
name of four letters <i>Lock</i>; in his later years he
always attached a final "e" to his patronymic.
At Exeter he had the advantage of being
trained by Edward Gibbons, brother of the great
Orlando, and, in addition to Gibbons' share in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
his training, he owed much to William Wake,
Organist, for whom he wrote one of his first
published works.
</p>

<p>
The period following Locke's later
inscription&mdash;1641&mdash;was one not calculated to encourage
or foster the art of music; the country was in a
state of civil war, the soldiers of Cromwell
wrought sad havoc in the Cathedrals, and the
musical portions of those establishments came
in for no small share of their destroying wrath.
</p>

<p>
At Westminster Abbey we are told "the
soldiers brake down the organs for pots of ale,"
and the Cathedral at which Locke served his
pupilage fared very badly at the hands of the
Roundheads.
</p>

<p>
It is natural, then, that during the stormy
times which marked that period we have little
intelligence concerning the doings of Locke.
We have the dates of some of his compositions,
one as early as 1651.  The chief interest,
however, which attaches to his work between
1650 and 1660 is that it is so much connected
with the stage, and in that way marks the
progress towards the Opera, of the English form of
which Locke is sometimes credited with being
the originator.  As instances of this kind of work
we might, perhaps, draw attention to his
association with Christopher Gibbons in Shirley's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
Masque <i>Cupid and Death</i> (1653), and the music
he wrote in 1656 for Davenant's <i>Siege of Rhodes</i>,
in the production of which he himself
shared&mdash;playing the part of the Admiral.  Henry Lawes
wrote some of the music of this Opera, and
Purcell's father was one of the actors.
</p>

<p>
The next item of importance that we have
concerning him is in the <i>Diary</i> of Samuel Pepys;
there, under date February 21st, 1659/60, we read:
</p>

<p class="block">
"After dinner I back to Westminster Hall.  Here
met with Mr. Lock and Pursell, Master of Musique,
and with them to the Coffee House, into a room
next the Water by ourselves.  Here we had a
variety of brave Italian and Spanish Songs, and a
Canon of eight voices which Mr. Locke had lately
made on these words 'Domine Salvum fac Regem,'
an admirable thing."
</p>

<p>
This is a very interesting entry.  It shows
Locke associated with Purcell's father; it gives
another instance of Mr Pepys never missing the
opportunity of cultivating the friendship of
good musicians, and, apart from the musical
side, as an historical matter of interest the words
of the Canon <i>Domine Salvum fac Regem</i> show
the feeling of loyalty towards the Crown which
ended in the Restoration; words which ten
years before it would have been a heresy to
utter.  It may be pointed out that the entry
February, 1659, by the old way of reckoning,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
was really February, 1660, and therefore the
year of the Restoration.  In the Ceremonies
connected with that great event Locke played
an important part; it was to his music for
<i>Sagbutts and Cornets</i> that the Royal Progress
was made, from the Tower to Whitehall, the day
before the Coronation 1661.  As a reward he
was made "Composer in ordinary to His
Majesty," and "One of the Gentlemen of His
Majesty's Private Musick."
</p>

<p>
For the next year or two he appears to have
been engaged in composition, both for Church
and stage; amongst the former may be
mentioned some Anthems, whilst his music for
Stapylton's <i>Stepmother</i> presents another instance
of his association with dramatic music.  This
dramatic side of his nature may have been the
cause of Roger North's complaint that "he
sacrificed the 'old Style' for the modes of his
time" and of "his theatrical way."
</p>

<p>
The year 1666, the year of the Fire of London,
is rather an important one in the consideration
of Locke's life.  It introduces us to him in
another character, and that of a literary type.
As will be seen later, he was a scathing and
bitter critic of his detractors, and first gave
evidence of this quality in the year now under notice.
The cause of this outpouring of his wrath was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
the treatment a Kyrie of his composition had
received at the hands of the Chapel Royal choir.
It would appear that he had set the Kyrie in an
original way, giving different music to each
response; such an innovation did not meet with
the approval of the Choir, and they seem to have
given it rather a rough time.  The result was
that Locke published it, and supplied a Preface
entitled "Modern Church Music; Pre-Accused,
Censured, and obstructed in its performance
before His Majesty, 1st of April, 1666.
Vindicated by its Author, Matthew Locke."  Some
of his observations are very severe and abusive.
I give a small portion of the somewhat long and
windy preface.
</p>

<p class="block">
"He is a slender observer of human actions who
finds not pride generally accompanied with
ignorance and malice, in what habit soever it wears.
In my case zeal was its vizor and innovation the
crime.  The fact, changing the custom of the
Church by varying that which was ever sung in
one tune, and occasioning confusion in the Service
by its ill performance.  That such defects should
take their rise from the difficulty or novelty of the
composition I utterly deny, the whole being a kind
of counterpoint, and no one change from the
beginning to the end but what naturally flows from, and
returns to the proper centre, the key".
</p>

<p>
With regard to the Vindication, however
convincing it might be, I believe the Kyrie was not
performed again at the Royal Chapel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
</p>

<p>
Pepys refers to the incident in his <i>Diary</i> of
September 2nd, 1667, in which he says: "Spent
all the afternoon, Pelling, Howe and I and my
boy, singing of Locke's response to the ten
commandments, which he hath set very finely, and
was a good while since sung before the King, and
spoiled in the performance which occasioned
the printing them, and are excellent good."  Mr
Pepys evidently sympathized with the lacerated
feelings of the injured author.
</p>

<p>
I may say that some little time ago I edited
these <i>Kyries</i> and the <i>Creed</i>, and they have been
sung in the Abbey and in various Cathedrals.
The <i>Kyries</i> are, many of them, very tuneful, and
the whole setting of <i>Kyrie</i> and <i>Creed</i> does
Locke great credit.
</p>

<p>
I have not space to dwell longer upon his
Church music, of which we have some excellent
specimens in the way of Anthems.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat later he was appointed Organist
of the Chapel at Somerset House; this Chapel
was part of the establishment of Queen Catherine,
the Queen of Charles II, who throughout her
life remained a Roman Catholic.  It would
appear from Roger North that Locke was not
altogether a success in this position.  He says:
"Locke was organist of Somerset House Chapel
as long as he lived, but the Italian Masters that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
served there did not approve of his manner of
play; but must be attended by more polite
hands, and one while, one Signor Baptista
Sabancino, and afterwards Signor Baptista
Draghi used the Great Organ, and Locke (who
must not be turned out of his place, nor the
execution) had a small Chamber Organ by, on
which he performed with them the same
Services."  This seems a somewhat humbling
position for such a man&mdash;and one wonders what he
said about it!
</p>

<p>
Another sharp controversy he took part in
was in answer to Mr Thomas Salmon, M.A., of
Trinity College, Oxford, who had written and
published <i>An Essay to the Advancement of Music
by casting away the perplexity of different cliffs
and writing all sorts of music in one universal
character</i>.
</p>

<p>
The desire to simplify musical signs seems to
have been an old theme and one that gave rise
to a fierce controversy between Matthew Locke
and Mr Salmon.  It is only fair to say that Mr
Salmon was not over judicious in his method of
recommending his scheme.  He seems to have
purposely hit out at music masters (of whom
Locke was one of the most eminent), and
suggested that their opposition to his ideas sprang
from the sordid desire to make as much as they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
could out of their pupils, by keeping them as
long as possible under tuition.
</p>

<p>
Matthew Locke replied to this in a treatise
entitled <i>The Present Practice of Musick
vindicated against the exceptions and new way of
attaining music lately published by Thomas Salmon,
M.A</i>.  The controversy was very warm.  You
shall hear a short address "To the Reader"
which will give some idea of the style of
discussion Locke adopted.
</p>

<p class="block">
Though I may without scruple aver that nothing
has done Mr. Salmon more kindness than that his
books have had the honour to be answered, yet I
have been forced to afford him this favour rather to
chastise the Reproaches which he hath thrown upon
the most eminent Professors of Musick than for
anything of learning that I found in him.  Those
gentlemen he accused of ignorance for not
embracing his illiterate absurdities for which it was
necessary to bring him to the "Bar of Reason" to do
him that justice which his follies merited.  Though
for the fame he gets by this, I shall not much envy
him, with whom it will fare as with common
criminals, who are seldom talked of above two or
three days after execution.
</p>

<p>
A little farther on he gets angry and says:
</p>

<p class="block">
Had I been "purblind," "copper-nosed,"
"sparrow-mouthed," "goggle-eyed," "hunch-backed"
or the like (ornaments which the best of my
antagonists are adorned with) what work would there
have been with me?
</p>

<p>
Attention has already been directed to Locke's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
association with dramatic music, and so it would
be well to glance briefly at the claim he
possesses to be considered the "Father of English
Opera."  The work which entitles him to be
ranked as the writer of the first English Opera
is Shadwell's <i>Psyche</i>; this, with the music to
<i>The Tempest</i>, was produced in 1673, with the
title of <i>The English Opera</i>.  It contained a
Preface, setting forth Locke's opinions on real
Opera.  North calls his works in this branch of
Art "semi-Operas," but from the title just
quoted it may be inferred that Locke, at any
rate, considered them full-grown specimens.
It should be added that the Act tunes in <i>Psyche</i>
were written by Draghi.  The writer on Opera
in Grove's <i>Dictionary</i> marks Purcell as the
originator of English Opera.  "Henry Purcell (he
says) transformed the Masque into the Opera,
or rather annihilated the one and introduced
the other."  Perhaps Roger North's term
"semi-Opera" is the best expression for Locke's
essays in this connection.
</p>

<p>
With regard to Locke's other dramatic music,
reference must be made to the <i>Macbeth</i> music,
which has for so many years been associated
with his name.  For long the matter has been
the subject of conjecture as to whether he was
really the author of it or not.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
</p>

<p>
The music of <i>Psyche</i> is so good that there
is no ground for saying he could not have written
the <i>Macbeth</i> music.  He was exceedingly
dramatic and also melodious.  There is a beautiful
Dialogue on the death of Lord Sandwich, the
great patron of Samuel Pepys, which is to be
found in the Pepys Library of Magdalene
College, Cambridge.  No doubt this was written at
the suggestion of Pepys.  And there is a
remarkable setting of Hamlet's soliloquy, also in MS.,
in Pepys' book, which I firmly believe is by Locke.
</p>

<p>
As usual Locke wrote an aggressive Preface
to <i>Psyche</i>.  It begins:
</p>

<p class="block">
That Poetry and Musick, the chief manifestives
of Harmonical Phancy, should provoke such
discordant effects in many is more to be pityed than
wondered at: it having become a fashionable art
to peck and carp at other men's conceptions, how
mean soever their own are.  Expecting, therefore,
to fall under the lash of some soft-headed or
hard-hearted composers (for there are too many better
at finding of faults than mending them) I shall
endeavour to remove these few blocks which perhaps
they may take occasion to stumble at.
</p>

<p>
He goes on to say the title Opera is of the Italian,
and claims that as far as his ability could reach,
he had written agreeably to the design of the
author, and that the variety of his setting was
never in Court or Theatre till now presented to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
the nation, "though I must confess there has
been something done, and more by me than any
other of this kind."
</p>

<p>
Locke evidently considered <i>Psyche</i> as a real
Opera and a novelty in this country.  The work
was dedicated to James, Duke of Monmouth,
who (the composer says) "gave this life by
your often hearing this practised and encouraged
and heartened the almost heartless undertakers
and performers."
</p>

<p>
Amongst his other works was one called
<i>Melothesia, or Certain general Rules for playing
upon a continued Bass</i>.  This is said to be the
first book of its kind, and he contributed to many
other works.  Roger North tells us "Locke set
most of the Psalms to music in parts for the use of
some vertuoso ladyes in the City, and he
composed a magnifick Consort of four parts after
the old style which is the last that hath been made."
</p>

<p>
His life was not long, but it was important,
and perhaps the greatest tribute to his memory
was that Henry Purcell wrote an ode
commemorative of his decease "On the death of his
worthy friend Mr Matthew Locke, Music
Composer in Ordinary to <i>His</i> Majesty, and Organist
of <i>Her</i> Majesty's Chappell, who dyed in August,
1677."

<h3>
X. PELHAM HUMFREY
</h3>

<h4>
1647&mdash;1674
</h4>

<p>
We have all heard of "Single-speech Hamilton,"
a Member of Parliament, who, it is said, made a
"single speech," and by it achieved lasting fame.
As a matter of history, Hamilton made other
speeches, but it was by the first that he earned
his well-known cognomen.  And we have a
somewhat similar example in connection with a
celebrated musician, John Jenkins.  Born in 1592,
he lived until 1678, and wrote, as North
expresses it, "horse-loads of music."  He was most
prolific and most celebrated, and yet until a few
years ago, when I revived many of his
compositions&mdash;<i>Dialogues, Fancies for Strings</i>, and
<i>Latin Motets</i>&mdash;not a note of his music was heard
anywhere, save one little piece.  But this was
sung in every school where vocal music was
taught&mdash;it is the charming little round <i>A boat,
a boat, haste to the ferry</i>.
</p>

<p>
The subject of our present consideration is
another example of the same fate.  "Pelham
Humfrey, Composer of the Grand Chant" is
about all people know of him.  This so-called
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
Grand Chant is known and sung in every
Protestant Church in the world.  Humfrey is,
however, a worthy member of the band of musicians
whose work I am following, and we will see what
else he did besides writing the Grand Chant.
</p>

<p>
Born in 1647, he is said to have been a nephew
of Colonel John Humphrey, Bradshaw's sword-bearer.
</p>

<p>
From the arms which were on his tomb we can
learn a little of his family and forbears&mdash;these
arms, I regret to say, have long since been
obliterated, in fact they had gone in Sir John
Hawkins' time, together with the epitaph; and
at the present time the exact position of the
grave can be only a matter of conjecture.[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>]  But
what was on it has been preserved to us in a
valuable old work, <i>Keepe's Monumenta
Westmonasteriensia</i>, 1682.  In this work a description
is given of the armorial bearings, and by them we
can trace him to an old Northamptonshire stock.
The family is mentioned as being settled in the
County in <i>The Visitation of Northampton</i> of
1564, but had disappeared from it before the next
Visitation some years later.
</p>

<p>
We know nothing of Pelham Humfrey's life
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
until 1660, the year of the Restoration, when we
find him, at the age of thirteen, entered as one
of the first set of children of the reconstructed
Chapel Royal Choir, under Henry Cooke,
generally known as Captain Cooke, who having fought
in the Civil War, obtained his Captain's
Commission as early in the struggle as 1642; and
retained his military title for the rest of his life.
</p>

<p>
While at the Chapel Royal, Humfrey
displayed signs of that precocity which so often
shows itself in the musical genius.  He began
composition while yet a boy, and in 1664 we find
the words of no fewer than five of his Anthems
published in Clifford's <i>Divine Services and
Anthems</i>.
</p>

<p>
A reference to one of these Anthems is in the
<i>Diary</i> of Samuel Pepys, which contains, by the
way, several interesting references to Humfrey's
career.  Under date November 22nd, 1663, we find:
</p>

<p class="block">
At Chapel: I had room in the Privy Seale pew
with other gentlemen, and there heard Dr. Lilligrew
preach.  The Anthem was good after Sermon,
being the 51st Psalm made for five voices by one of
Captain Cooke's boys, a pretty boy.  And they say
there are four or five of them that can do as much.
And here I first perceived that the King is a little
Musical and kept good time with his hand all along
the Anthem.
</p>

<p>
Now that Anthem was written by a Choir-boy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
in the Royal Chapel, but it is a remarkable fact,
as Pepys says, that he was not the only
boy-composer in the same choir and at the same time.
Captain Cooke appears to have been rarely
fortunate in having in his newly-formed choral
body a set of phenomenally gifted boys, and
doubtless no small credit is due to the loyal and
gallant musician for the skill and care he must
have devoted to their training.
</p>

<p>
Captain Cooke must have been a clever teacher
and a still cleverer selector of boys for his choir;
and this brilliant little school he gathered round
him (including such names as Humfrey, Blow,
and Purcell) shines out like a beacon light in our
musical world.  A curious and interesting fact
bearing upon this came to my knowledge quite
lately.  A Thesis for a Doctor's degree in the
University of Paris (in 1912) was on the subject of
<i>Captain Cooke's Choir Boys</i>, and it was a clever
yet concise account of the work done by these
three pupils of Cooke&mdash;Humfrey, Blow, and
Purcell.  English music seems to be looking up
when we find a period of our musical history and
three of our past great musicians taken as the
subject for a thesis in a foreign University!
</p>

<p>
The same year that witnessed the production
of this Anthem was an all-important one, not
only for Humfrey but also for English art.  On
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
leaving the Royal Choir, Charles II sent him
abroad to continue his musical studies; the cost
of the trip was paid out of the Secret Service
Fund, and was expended in the following way:
</p>

<p>
1664.  "To defray the charge of his journey
into France and Italy £200."  In the two
following years also he was granted £100 and £150
respectively.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time Humfrey spent abroad was
passed in Paris with J. B. Lully, an Italian
by birth but a Frenchman by adoption, the most
celebrated dramatic musical composer of his
day.  He wrote many Operas in the most varied
styles, both grave and gay, was the composer of a
good deal of sacred music, and was also a reformer
in Opera-writing; he introduced the accompanied
recitative in place of the Italian <i>Recitative secco</i>,
making many changes in the ballets.  Of still more
importance was his development of the Overture,
for which service he cannot be too highly valued.
</p>

<p>
It is very probable that the instruction given by
Lully to Humfrey was less by precept than by
example.  The pupil listened with eager ears
to his master's music and doubtless often took
part in the performance of it.  Under this
influence&mdash;the influence of the greatest master of
dramatic music of his time&mdash;it is not surprising
that the already precocious genius of the young
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
Englishman quickened, and that he returned to
his native country with a different conception of
his art.  Another world had been opened up to
him whose earliest instruction had, necessarily,
been chiefly confined to the ecclesiastical side
of it.
</p>

<p>
Before his return to England he had been
appointed a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, in the
place of one Thomas Hazard, January, 1667, and
he was duly sworn in the October following.  A
glance at Pepys' <i>Diary</i> under dates November 1st
and 15th, 1667, gives us that shrewd observer's
opinion of our hero as he appears fresh from his
Continental trip.
</p>

<p class="block">
November 1st, 1667.  To Chapel, and heard a
fine Anthem made by Pelham, who is come over.
</p>

<p>
The entry, however, of a fortnight later is of
more interest, as apparently being Mr Pepys'
first personal encounter with him since his return.
</p>

<p class="block">
November 15th, 1667.  Home, and there I find,
as I expected, Mr. Caesar and little Pelham
Humfrey lately returned from France, and is an absolute
Monsieur as full of form and confidence and vanity,
and disparages everything and everybody's skill
but his own.  But to hear how he laughs at all the
King's Musick here, as Blagrave and others, that
they cannot keep time nor tune nor understand
anything; and that Grebus, the Frenchman, the
King's Master of the Music, how he understands
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
nothing nor can play on any instrument and so
cannot compose; and that he will give him a lift
out of his place; and that he and the King are
mighty great.  I had a good dinner for them, a
venison pasty and some fowl, and after dinner we
did play, he on the Theorbo, Mr. Caesar on his
French lute, and I on the viol, but made but mean
Musique, nor do I see that this Frenchman do so
much wonders on the Theorbo, but without question,
he is a good musician, but his vanity do offend me.
</p>

<p>
Grebus (or rather Grabu) was the King's
Master of the Music.  He displaced Bannister,
who was dismissed, according to the historians,
because he championed English violinists and
said he preferred them to Frenchmen.  He may
have said this, but the real cause of his dismissal
was that he kept back the money which he ought
to have paid to the Private Band!  King Charles
has often been blamed for dismissing Bannister
on account of his patriotic sentiments and defence
of English players, but this charge is not true.
</p>

<p>
Returning to Mr Pepys for a record of his next
day's doings, November 16, 1667, we find a very
interesting reference to Humfrey and a somewhat
scathing criticism from the Diarist:
</p>

<p class="block">
1667, November 16th.  To White Hall, where
there is to be a performance of Music of Pelham's
before the King.  The company not come; but I
did go into the Music Room where Captain Cooke
and many others, and here I did hear the best and
the smallest Organ go that ever I saw in my life
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
and such a one as by the grace of God I will have the
next year, if I continue in this Condition, whatever
it cost me.
</p>

<p>
Mr Pepys then records a short walk and talk
with Mr Gregory, returning to Whitehall:
</p>

<p class="block">
And there got into the theatre room and there
heard both the vocall and instrumentall Music,
where the little fellow (Pelham Humfrey) stood
keeping time, but for my part I see no great matter,
but quite the contrary, in both sorts of Music.
The composition, I believe, is very good, but no
more of delightfulness to the eare or understanding,
but what is very ordinary.
</p>

<p>
In addition to being a composer, Humfrey was
an accomplished lutenist, and in the State Papers
for the year 1668, under date January 20th, we
find a promotion of his in the Royal Service;
the record runs as follows:
</p>

<p class="block">
January 20th, 1668.  Warrant to pay Pelham
Humfreys, Musician in Ordinary on the Lute, in
place of Nich. Sawyer deceased £40 yearly, and
£16 2s. 6d. for Livery.
</p>

<p>
On May 29th of this same year Mr Pepys again
refers to him:
</p>

<p class="block">
May 29th, 1668.  Home, whither by agreement
by and by comes Mercer and Gayet and two
gentlemen with them, Mr. Monteith and Pelham, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
former a swaggering young handsome gentleman,
the latter a sober citizen merchant.[<a id="chap10fn2text"></a><a href="#chap10fn2">2</a>]  Both sing,
and the latter with great skill, the other no skill,
but a good voice and a good basse, but used only
to tavern tunes; and so I spent all this evening
till eleven at night, singing with them till I was
tired of them, because of the swaggering fellow,
tho' the girl Mercer did mightily commend him
before me.
</p>

<p>
Later in the year (July) another reference is
made in the <i>Diary</i>:
</p>

<p class="block">
July 11th, 1668.  So home, it being almost night
(Mr. Pepys had been after an espinette at Deptford),
and there find in the garden Pelling, who hath
brought Tempest, Wallington, and Pelham to sing,
and there had most excellent Musick late, in the
dark with great pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Humfrey's Sacred music is a clear evidence of
his French experience.  He puts symphonies for
strings and is dramatic at times and often
somewhat light.  An Anthem <i>O Praise the Lord</i> is a
good example of the latter tendency.  There are
two short Bass solos, one to the words <i>Sing
praises lustily</i>, which is almost like the song of a
jovial sailor!  It is in triple time, and is the sort
of thing King Charles would certainly have beaten
time to with his hand "all along the Anthem," in
Pepys' words.  The Bass solo in the Anthem he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
wrote when a boy and before his French training
is in a quite different style, and might have
been written by any of our good Cathedral writers,
such as Locke, or Blow, or even Purcell.
</p>

<p>
In addition to his Sacred works Humfrey wrote
three Odes and many songs.  These latter fall
under the critical notice of Dr Burney, who refers
to them, I think, rather unfairly and harshly.
Speaking of a collection called <i>Choice Songs and
Aires</i>, Burney says: "Among these songs, to the
number of near fifty, there is not one air that is
either ingenious, graceful, cheerful or solemn:
an insipid languor or vulgar pertness pervades
the whole.  From Pelham Humphry, whose
Church Music is so excellent, I own I expected to
find originality, or merit of some kind or other;
but his songs are quite on a level with the rest."
</p>

<p>
Burney's remarks are not only spiteful, but
untrue.  To mention only one song, Humfrey's
setting of <i>Where the Bee Sucks</i>, which he wrote
for Dryden and Davenant's altered version of
<i>The Tempest</i> (the oldest setting but one which we
possess), is charming, both as regards melody
and harmony.  The first part is in the minor
key, for which Humfrey seems&mdash;like Purcell&mdash;to
have a weakness.  There is an effective change to
the Tonic Major at <i>Merrily, merrily shall I live
now</i>, with a most striking and delicious drop of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
7th (I expect Burney regarded this as a crudity),
To me the song seems one of the best of the time.
</p>

<p>
Humfrey went on adding rapidly to his
honours.  On January 24th, 1672, he was elected
one of the wardens of "the Corporation for
regulating the Art and Science of Musick," and in
July of the same year his old master, Captain
Cooke, died; his death being accelerated&mdash;so
Antony Wood tells us&mdash;by chagrin at finding
himself getting supplanted by his old pupil.
This I do not believe: Cooke would have had a
soul above such foibles, and had too many
successful pupils to be jealous of poor little
Humfrey.
</p>

<p>
However this may be, Humfrey succeeded him
as Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal, and
later, jointly with Thomas Purcell, he was
appointed Composer in Ordinary for the Violins
to His Majesty.
</p>

<p>
It was in this year, 1672, that he wrote a
charming little song called <i>Wherever I am and
Whatever I do</i>.  It was written for Dryden's
<i>Conquest of Granada</i>, produced in that year.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of any importance is chronicled of him
for the last two years of his all too short life.
He died at Windsor on July 13th, 1674, and was
buried in the Cloisters of Westminster Abbey,
near the south east door.  His last will and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
testament, witnessed by his old schoolfellow, Dr
Blow, is interesting:
</p>

<p class="block">
Aprill ye 23rd, 74.

<p class="block">

and sole executrix).
</p>

<p>
Humfrey's life, brief though it was, must be
regarded as a turning point in our art's
history&mdash;not alone by his own compositions, but by the
infusion of his influence into the greater Purcell.
He was not only Purcell's master at the Chapel
Royal, but actually composed an Anthem jointly
with Purcell, called <i>By the Waters of Babylon</i>.
In Boyce's opinion "he was the first of our ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
composers who had the least idea of
musical pathos and expression of the words," but
this is an exaggeration.
</p>

<p>
This great advance in our music was carried on
by the immortal Purcell, who, as a choir-boy
under Humfrey, was, no doubt, an eager listener
to the "new effects" which his master introduced.
The pupil is so great, one is in danger of
forgetting the master.  At least here we have
endeavoured to do some justice to the
short-lived genius Pelham Humfrey.

<p class="footnote">

[<a href="#chap10fn1text">1</a>] I have lately identified the spot.  Keepe was for eighteen

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap10fn2"></a>

swaggering young handsome gentleman, and Monteith as the
sober citizen merchant.

<h3>
XI. DR JOHN BLOW
</h3>

<h4>
1648&mdash;1708
</h4>

<p>
If there is one name among the Twelve Musicians
with whom I am dealing in this course of Lectures
to which I desire specially to do justice, it is that
of Dr. John Blow.  As a child I sang his Anthems
in Rochester Cathedral, and I well remember the
delight with which I listened to, and took part in,
his beautiful and expressive <i>I beheld, and lo a
great multitude</i>, and <i>I was in the Spirit on the
Lord's day</i>.  In those days the great masterpieces
of the English Cathedral School were constantly
done, and very well done, at Rochester, and none
of the Anthems except I may say, perhaps,
Purcell's great Anthem <i>O Sing unto the Lord</i>,
touched me and thrilled me as did that of Blow.
And as long as I played in Manchester Cathedral
and Westminster Abbey, so long did I feel the
power and religious impressions of these splendid
specimens of Blow's genius.  Of course there are
many Anthems and Services by this master, but
none, to me at least, ever spoke so eloquently as
did the two I have mentioned.  This is one reason
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
why I approach the subject of Blow's career with
such a desire to do him justice.  Another is the
strange neglect of most of his secular music, and
lastly the absurd and ignorant criticism of Dr
Burney, as displayed in his <i>History</i>, when he talks
of "Blow's crudities."
</p>

<p>
Without further delay let us proceed to trace
his musical life.  I refrain, on account of time,
from dwelling much on biographical details in
these Lectures.  So I will merely state that it
seems pretty certain that Blow was born at
North Collingham, in Nottinghamshire, and
baptised in the Parish Church of Newark in
February 1648-9.  Let us begin with recording
his admission as a Chorister to the Chapel
Royal&mdash;one of the "clever boys" whom Captain
Cooke got together and taught.  Of his
school-fellow, Pelham Humfrey, I have already spoken,
and, like Humfrey, Blow composed Anthems
while in the choir.  It is possible&mdash;or rather, I
think, probable&mdash;that an entry in Pepys' <i>Diary</i>
refers to him.  Under the head of August 21,
1667, we read:
</p>

<p class="block">
This morning come two of Captain Cooke's boys,
whose voices are broke, and are gone from the
Chappell, but have extraordinary skill, and they and my
boy, with his broken voice, did sing three parts:
their names were Blaew and Loggings, but notwithstanding
their skill, yet to hear them sing with their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
broken voices, which they could not command to
keep in tune, would make a man mad, so bad it was.
</p>

<p>
If this refers to Blow he would be about
nineteen years old, and could have had but a very
broken voice.  But it is not impossible, as many
boys retain their voices until a good age, and
continue singing "alto" in a moderate sort of
style.  It is hardly likely there would be a boy
named Blaew and one named Blow.  And there
was some arrangement whereby boys who had
left the Choir continued to reside with the Masters,
possibly to study.[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
At the early age of twenty-one, in 1669, he
became Organist of Westminster Abbey, and the
appointment, apparently, was not enough for his
ambition (or, more probably, for his needs!),
for in 1674 he succeeded Humfrey as Master of the
Children of the Chapel Royal, becoming Organist
also (while still holding Westminster Abbey) in
1676.  As regards his degree of Mus. Doc. I have
(on the authority of the late Dr Southgate) to
make a little correction of former statements.
It has generally been said the degree was
conferred upon Blow by Archbishop Sancroft, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
Dr Southgate told me in a note, when I was about
to lecture on Blow, some years ago, that the
degree was granted by Bancroft's <i>representative</i>
the Dean of Canterbury&mdash;the Archbishop being
dead.  It is marked in the Lambeth Register
"<i>Sede vacante</i>": it was thus bestowed when the
"See was vacant."  It is a curious fact that Blow
gave up his Abbey post in 1680, being succeeded
by Purcell; and on Purcell's death, in 1695, he
was again appointed organist of the Abbey, and
held that post until his death.
</p>

<p>
But I have to record yet another important
Cathedral appointment which our indefatigable
musician held.  He was Almoner and Master of
the Choristers in St Paul's Cathedral, holding
those offices for six years, from 1687 to 1693.
Again he seems to have resigned in favour of a
pupil, Mr Jeremiah Clarke.  It is a remarkable
testimony to the esteem in which he was held
that he should have filled posts at the Chapel
Royal, St Paul's Cathedral, and Westminster
Abbey, all at the same time.  Bishops, in the old
days, often presided over a Diocese, filled a
Canonry or directed a College and occupied a
"Living" or two, simultaneously; but Blow
seems to me to have been the greatest Organist
pluralist on record!
</p>

<p>
But this is a testimony to his worth, and in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
following up our investigation of his contributions
to music I will not dwell longer upon his
Church music, except to mention that he wrote
an Anthem <i>I was glad</i>, for the opening of St Paul's
Cathedral in 1697, and to tell the story of the
composition of the Anthem which I mentioned
in the early part of my lecture, <i>I beheld and Lo</i>!
When it was performed in the Chapel Royal, the
King (who had asked him to compose it) sent
Father Petre to say he was greatly pleased with
it; "but (added Petre) I myself think it too
long!"  "That (answered Blow) is the opinion
of but one fool&mdash;I heed it not."  The Priest was
greatly incensed at this remark, and it is said that,
had not James II lost his place by his sudden
flight to France, Dr Blow would have lost <i>his</i>!
</p>

<p>
Among the Anthems of this composer may be
mentioned two which he wrote for the Coronation
of James II, and he also took part in the funeral
of William III in the Abbey, receiving, according
to an Abbey record, the very large fee of 7s. 10d. for
the latter.  He does not seem to have directed
the music at the Coronation, but took part in the
choir.  On the death of his pupil, Purcell, he
wrote an ode, the words by Dryden, beginning
<i>Mark how the lark and linnet sing</i>.
</p>

<p>
I must not omit to mention that he and Purcell
were the Organists selected by Father Smith to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
display the organ of the Temple Church at the
memorable competition between Smith and
Harris, the two rival organ-builders.  Smith won
the day, and showed his wisdom in getting the
best men to preside at his instrument.  It was
the custom for many years to have an <i>Ode for
St Cecilia's Day</i> composed for and performed in
Stationers Hall on the Saint's Day.  Blow wrote
the second of these <i>Odes</i> in 1684&mdash;the year of the
Temple Church competition.  He published, in
1700, a great collection of his secular vocal music,
under the title of <i>Amphion Anglicus</i>, and in his
dedication to the Princess Anne of Denmark he
announces that he is preparing "as fast as I can a
second musical Present, my Church Services and
Divine composition."  He gives his sentiments
with regard to Sacred composition in the same
dedication, which are worth repeating:
</p>

<p class="block">
To those in truth I have ever more especially
consecrated the thoughts of my whole life.  All the
rest I consider but the blossoms or rather the leaves
those I only esteem as the Fruits of all my labours
in this kind.  With them I began my first Raptures
in this Art, with them I hope calmly and
comfortably to finish my days.
</p>

<p>
The composer did not carry out his design,
though he lived about eight years after this.
</p>

<p>
A very interesting work, which has only of late
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
years been made known, is a Masque entitled
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>.  Some years ago I noticed it
among the music in the Chapter Library at
Westminster.  It has since been edited by Mr
Arkwright, and, quite lately, produced upon the stage
at Glastonbury.  It is very interesting, as it
shows that Blow, like Purcell, had a leaning to
dramatic music and this Masque is specially
noticeable as it consists of musical dialogue&mdash;not
spoken&mdash;thus coming very near to a
little Opera.
</p>

<p>
Blow also contributed to some <i>Choice Lessons for
the Harpsichord</i>, a collection published by
Playford, to which also Henry Purcell contributed.
There are also interesting specimens of organ
music, among which is a curious arrangement of
the <i>Hundredth Psalm Tune</i> "as they are played
in Churches and Chapels."  I have also a copy
of a MS. <i>Lesson on the Hundredth Psalm</i>.  It
would now be called a Choral Prelude for the
Organ.  After a short introduction, the whole
tune appears at intervals in the Bass, with very
florid upper counterpoint.  It is evidence of Blow's
knowledge of organ effects and of his ability as a
player.
</p>

<p>
A writer in 1711, three years after Blow's
death, tells us "he was reckoned the greatest
Master in the world for playing most gravely and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
serenely in his Voluntaries", and we have
Purcell's testimony to him as "one of the greatest
masters in the world".  With this testimony
before him it seems incredible that Dr Burney
should have made such a fierce onslaught upon
this really excellent man and versatile musician,
on account of what he calls his "crudities."  He
has actually given four pages of music type in his
History, full of quotations of Blow's misdeeds.  I
have examined these carefully, and in many cases
the examples are really a remarkable testimony
to Blow's advanced ideas, and his feeling for
pathetic and expressive harmony.  In some
specimens there are obvious mis-prints, accidentals
omitted, etc., which Burney, had he not been
prejudiced, would certainly have perceived.
But it is not worth while to follow up this matter,
although I am sorry to say Sir Frederick Ouseley
took rather the same line when commenting on
Blow's music.  He really pays Blow a
compliment when he says that "he always appears to
have been trying experiments in harmony or
introducing new combinations and discords".
This was what was said of another great musician,
Monteverde, to whom we owe so much, and such
criticisms only bring discredit upon the writers
who failed to see the value behind the novelty.
Sir Hubert Parry, in speaking of these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
"crudities" says "they do Blow, for the most part,
great credit, for they show that he adventured
beyond the range of the mere conventional, and
often with the success that betokens genuine
musical insight."
</p>

<p>
I have already commented upon his greatest
Anthems <i>I beheld and lo!</i> and <i>I was in the Spirit</i>.
They are full of examples of Blow's melodious
power, and this also comes out in some of his
secular airs.  Perhaps one of the best is his
beautiful song which is to be found in <i>Amphion
Anglicus</i> entitled <i>The Self Banished</i> beginning
"It is not that I love you less"; the words are
by Waller, and the music is worthy of them.
</p>

<p>
Blow, as described by Sir John Hawkins, was
"a very handsome man in his person, and
remarkable for a gravity and decency in his
deportment, suited to his station".
</p>

<p>
This worthy musician died in 1708, aged 60,
and is buried in Westminster Abbey, near the
old entrance to the organ-loft and in close
proximity to Purcell.  A fine monument is erected
near the spot, and a specimen of his composition,
in the form of a <i>Gloria</i> from one of his services is
engraved thereupon.  This <i>Gloria</i> is said to have
been sung at St Peter's at Rome.  I remember an
interesting matter in connection with this
monument.  In my early days at the Abbey (during
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
Dean Stanley's time) the Emperor of Brazil paid
a visit and was shown round the Abbey by the
Dean.  The only thing he specially asked to be
shown was "Dr. Blow's monument"!  The
Dean told me His Majesty inspected it very
closely and seemed to be reading the music.
He probably knew more about Blow's music than
Burney's <i>History</i>!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn1text">1</a>] There is an account preserved in the Bodleian Library
of Blow being paid £40 a year for "keeping and teaching
two boys" but this was in 1685.  It shows that it was
usual for boys whose voices were gone, to be kept on for
tuition.

<h3>
XII. HENRY PURCELL
</h3>

<h4>
1658&mdash;1695
</h4>

<p>
In Henry Purcell I reach the last and the
greatest of my Twelve Good Musicians.  And to
attempt to consider and discuss completely his life
and work in the short space of a University
Lecture, would be an absurd effort.  But, as I
have before pointed out, my object has been to
endeavour to interest the musical student&mdash;amateur
and professional&mdash;in certain prominent
masters of music, and in the remarkable progress
made in our own country by their aid in the
seventeenth century.  I can do little more than
arouse interest, and I cannot pretend to write
a complete history, but I trust the Lectures will
have helped to fill up the "blank" which Sir
Hubert Parry declared existed in many minds
as regards the music of this period.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-118"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-118.jpg" alt="Henry Purcell" />
<br />
Henry Purcell
</p>

<p>
In the consideration of the various musicians
of whom I have already treated I have avoided
biographical detail.  As a rule information in
these matters may be gleaned from the
well-known books of reference.  But in the case of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
Purcell I am obliged to enlarge a little on his life,
in the hope that I may be able to contribute a
few interesting facts with regard to his family
that are not generally known.
</p>

<p>
Let me begin, then, with Purcell's father.  It
is an extraordinary thing that we know nothing
whatever of him until we find his name among
distinguished musicians, such as Captain Cooke,
Locke, and Lawes, as one of the performers in
the <i>Siege of Rhodes</i>, in 1656.  In the Preface to
this publication it is claimed that "The Musick
was composed and both the Vocal and Instrumental
is exercised by the most transcendent of
England in that Art."
</p>

<p>
What did the elder Purcell do before he
attained to such a position?  We know absolutely
nothing as regards his origin, his training, or his
career up to this.  I have made diligent search
in the archives of Westminster to see if there
were anything to be learned there, and have
gleaned a few small facts.
</p>

<p>
The name of Roger Pursell occurs in a bill for
bringing timber to the College&mdash;in August 1628.
The items of the bill include Carriage by land
1s. 6d., for watching 6d., for helping to land ye
timber 6d.  This would seem to apply to a load
of timber brought from a distance for the use of
the carpenters of the College.  Roger Pursell
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
may have come up with the timber or he may
have been one of the carpenters.  He was paid
3s. for two days' work.  The name appears again
in 1659 when we find in a page of accounts
"Expended by George Blackborn and Joseph
Hobbes for the travelling charges about the
Colledge affaires at Offord, in the County of
Huntingdon" the following note: "In the
Bonds taken from Mr Throgmorton and <i>Roger
Pursell</i> there is included £4 towards travelling
charges."  Then Roger Pursell is spoken of as
"the 'Bayliffe' of Mr Giles."  It is rather
curious that the name of Roger Pursell should
occur at such a wide interval, 1628 and again in
1659.  One wonders if Roger's connection with
the Abbey and its property was the beginning of
the musical members of the family coming to
Westminster.
</p>

<p>
There was a Shropshire Purcell family of some
standing, and in the <i>Herald's Visitation of
Shropshire</i> in 1623 it was given as of Onslow,
and Shrewsbury; and there were many
distinguished Purcells in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
We know and hear nothing more of the elder
Purcell after the production of the <i>Siege of
Rhodes</i> in 1656 until his name appears in a book
in the Library at Westminster.  This book
records the admission of one or two Petty Canons
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
in 1660, and the payment by them of 5s. for the
entry.  Mr Henry Purcell's name is also entered
with the note "instead of 5s. <i>this book</i>."
</p>

<p>
Here, then, we have the great musician's
father installed in the Abbey as Master of the
Choristers (not organist also) and Copyist.  He
was also a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal and
a Singing Man of Westminster.  Later on we
find him a member of the Royal Band (1663).
All these important appointments testify to his
leading musical position.
</p>

<p>
We have a glimpse of him in Pepys' <i>Diary</i>,
under date February 21st, 1660.
</p>

<p class="block">
"After dinner I back to Westminster Hall.  Here
I met with Mr. Lock and Pursell, Master of Music,
and with them to the Coffee House into a room
next the Water by ourselves.  Here we had variety
of brave Italian and Spanish songs and a Canon for
eight voices which Mr. Locke had lately made on
these words '<i>Domine Salvum fac Regem</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
Another small fact of interest in connection
with the elder Purcell is furnished me by my
brother of Chester.  He finds in the Chirk Castle
accounts, by the steward of Sir Thomas Myddelton,
an allusion to Mr Purcell, who is, no doubt,
our elder Purcell.  Dr. Bridge writes as follows:

<p class="block">
As a rule only the names of important personages
are put in the accounts.  As the Steward did not
<i>live</i> in London, it looks as if Mr. Purcell was a former
acquaintance from somewhere near Chirk.  This
place is on the borders of three Counties of which
Shropshire is one, and as the Purcells probably
came from Salop, their birth-place or place of
residence, may have been at the Chirk end of the
County.  Possibly Mr. Purcell was an old friend of
the Steward's."
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt the elder Purcell lived
in the place called the Almonry, where the
"Singing Men" had houses.  These stood where
the well-known Westminster Palace Hotel now
stands.  And here his distinguished son was born.[<a id="chap12fn1text"></a><a href="#chap12fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
It is generally stated that he was born in 1658.
It seems, however, just as likely&mdash;or even more
likely&mdash;the date should be 1659.  Unfortunately
it has been impossible to find the record of his
baptism.  The Register at St Margaret's Church,
Westminster, for this period (which was then
very carefully kept) does not show Henry
Purcell's name.  The approximate date is fixed
fairly well for us by the fact that in June, 1683,
Purcell published some Sonatas to which his
portrait was prefixed.  On this portrait he is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
said to be "<i>aetat: suae</i> 24," i.e. in the
twenty-fourth year of his age.  Again on his monument
in the Abbey we find "<i>Anno Aetatis suae 37</i>,"
i.e., in the thirty-seventh year of his age.
Therefore, if he was in his thirty-seventh year on
November 21, 1695 (the date of his death), he
must have been born between November 21st,
1658, and November 20th, 1659.
</p>

<p>
Not only is his baptism during these years not
recorded at St Margaret's, but the <i>Rate Books</i> of
St Margaret's for 1658 and 1659 <i>do not contain
the name of Purcell</i>, as they certainly would have
had his father had a house in the parish.
</p>

<p>
A friend has made most careful enquiries for
me on this point.  I expect the Almonry was in
the precincts of Westminster Abbey, and so
would not be "in the parish," and it is quite
reasonable to suppose the child born in the
Almonry was christened in the Abbey: but I have
never yet found any record of this.  Purcell's
own son, Edward, was christened in the Abbey
in 1689.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to know that Henry Lawes
lived also in the Almonry, and so must have
known the little boy Purcell; but, as Lawes
died in 1662, the child could not have given any
great proof of his future genius.  The elder
Purcell died in 1664, and the young boy was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
placed in the Chapel Royal Choir at the early age
of six years.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Purcell, brother of the elder Purcell,
was a distinguished musician also and a member
of the Chapel Royal, besides holding other
important posts.  He looked after his clever little
nephew, and was a real father to him.  As in the
case of Henry Purcell, Senior, we know nothing
of the previous history of Thomas Purcell until
we find him in his high position.  Who trained
him and his brother Henry we know not.
</p>

<p>
Henry Purcell was thus one of the remarkable
set of boys to which I have often alluded in these
Lectures, among his fellow choristers being
Pelham Humfrey and Blow.  Like the other boys,
he began to compose, and the first reliable
composition we have was the <i>Address of the Children
of the Chapel Royal to the King and their Master,
Captain Cooke, on His Majestie's Birthday
A.D. 1670, composed by MASTER PURCELL, one
of the Children of the said Chapel</i>.
</p>

<p>
Purcell, no doubt, owed much to Captain
Cooke, but it is also certain that the influence of
Pelham Humfrey, with the experience he gained
by his studies with Lully, must have made a deep
impression.  As we know, Humfrey died at the
early age of twenty-seven, and Purcell continued
his studies with Blow, whose monument in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
Abbey records he was "Master to the famous
Henry Purcell."
</p>

<p>
The first appointment Purcell held was that
of copyist to Westminster Abbey (1676), a post
which his father had held before him.  We know
little for certain as to his compositions for the
Church in his early days.  As a matter of fact,
he seems to have been drawn (like Henry Lawes)
more to the secular side, writing for the theatre.
It has been suggested that he was introduced to
this kind of work by Locke, who we know was
a prominent composer for the stage.  We must
also remember that Humfrey would, very likely,
have helped to influence the mind of the young
Purcell in that direction.  On Locke's death in
1677 Purcell wrote an ode <i>On the death of his
worthy friend, Matthew Locke</i>.
</p>

<p>
In 1680 Dr Blow resigned his position as
Organist of Westminster Abbey, and Purcell
succeeded him.  There is no record of Blow
resigning or the cause of it in the Chapter Books;
one simply finds in the Treasurer's accounts that
Purcell drew the salary as Organist instead of
Blow.  Probably his appointment to
Westminster turned his mind more towards Church
than stage.
</p>

<p>
The composition of the Opera <i>Dido and
Æneas</i> is, I think, proved by Mr Barclay Squire's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
clever article on Purcell's dramatic music not to
be a composition of his early years.  It is not
possible for me to go minutely into the subject
of Purcell's many compositions, but I will for a
few moments call attention to what I consider
almost his master-piece.  I allude to the
splendid and original set of Sonatas which he issued
in 1683.[<a id="chap12fn2text"></a><a href="#chap12fn2">2</a>]  This was Purcell's first publication,
and it was issued from St Ann's Lane, beyond
Westminster Abbey, where the composer
resided&mdash;having been married in 1681.  (It should be
added that he was made Organist of the Chapel
Royal in 1682, holding that post at the same
time as the Abbey.)
</p>

<p>
These Sonatas are a very interesting study in
Purcell's career.  Like many of the composers
mentioned in these Lectures, Purcell wrote
Fancies; but the Sonatas are a very different
thing.  Written for Two Violins 'Cello and Basso
Continuo, and consisting of three or four
movements of differing character, they are a
wonderful advance on anything previously done
in this direction, either in England or abroad.
</p>

<p>
Corelli issued his Sonatas in the same year that
Purcell's appeared.  But Corelli's&mdash;although
beautiful&mdash;have not the depth or originality of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
Purcell's, which are admirably written for the
strings and abound in clever devices, but are in
no way dull or suggestive of vocal writing.  The
three strings are often complete without the
Continuo, but occasionally there is an extra part
for this.  My own experience of them in
performance is that the least possible accompaniment
is best, and it should be remembered that
the Continuo is not written for a modern
pianoforte with its powerful tone, but for the
Harpsichord or Organ.
</p>

<p>
Purcell in his Preface says: "for its Author
he has faithfully endeavoured a just imitation of
the most favour'd Italian Masters".  He goes
on to explain the meaning of certain Italian
"terms of Art perhaps unusual," such as <i>Adagio,
Grave, Presto, Largo</i>, etc., and concludes with a
wish that his book may fall into no other hands
but those who carry musical souls about them;
for he is willing to flatter himself into a belief
that with such his labours will seem neither
unpleasant nor unprofitable."
</p>

<p>
The question of the models that Purcell had in
writing these fine Sonatas and what famous
Italian Masters he imitated has been often
debated.  For myself I cannot but believe that
Purcell owed much to a remarkable Neapolitan
violinist, Nicola Matteis.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
</p>

<p>
This Italian violinist and composer came to
London about 1672, and resided there till after
Purcell's death.  The date of Matteis's birth is
not known, but the accounts of his playing given
from personal observation by such authorities
as John Evelyn in his contemporary <i>Diary</i>, and
Roger North in his <i>Memoirs of Musick</i>, show that
he came here as a mature artist.  Purcell was
then fifteen years old, and during the eleven
years which elapsed till the publication of the
1683 Purcell Sonatas, Matteis was much the most
prominent foreign musician, and the only Italian
musician of any rank resident in London.  The
propagation of musical styles from one country
to another was carried out in those days very little
by the dissemination of copies, whether
manuscript or printed, and much more by the activity
of persons who went here and there giving
performances and concerts.  And Roger North says
specifically: "But as yet wee have given no
account of the decadence of the French musick,
and the Italian coming in its room.  This
happened by degrees, and the overture was by
accident, for the coming over of Sig. Nicolai Matteis
gave the first start.  He was an excellent
musician, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c."  Purcell, the Organist of
Westminster Abbey, must of course have known
Matteis, as he directed the concerts of Chief
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
Justice Francis North (Roger North's brother)
in Queen Street, and it is evident from the
writings of Roger that the Norths were supporters
of Matteis.  In the Bodleian Library I have
found Chief Justice North's name inscribed as
the owner on one of the volumes of Matteis's
<i>Aires for the Violin</i>.  Then as to the explanation
of Italian terms in Purcell's Preface, it is a little
singular that much the same sort of information
is found prefixed to Matteis's second volume of
Violin Pieces.  Again I have discovered in MS. parts
in the Bodleian Library, and had
performed at a Lecture at the Royal Institution,
a Sonata in A by Matteis, in the exact Sonata
form used by Purcell in 1683; and, though
the date of this MS. composition cannot be
traced, it is at least as likely to have been
composed before 1683 as after.  However, I am not
asserting that a composer like Purcell copied
Matteis's works.  I am only saying that it was
Matteis who made the Italian chamber-music
prevalent in London, and that but for him
Purcell would possibly never have thought
or written in that style.  And I cannot better
conclude than by quoting from one of
North's voluminous manuscripts, <i>Essay of
Musical Ayre</i> (Brit. Museum, <i>Addit.</i> MSS., 32,
536, folio 78):
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
</p>

<p class="block">
The poor man (Matteis) as a grateful legacy to the
English nation, left with them a generall savour for
the Itallian manner of Harmony, and after him the
French was wholly layd aside, and nothing in towne
had a relish without a spice of Itally, and the masters
here began to imitate them, <i>wittness Mr. H. Purcell,
in his noble set of Sonnatas</i>.
</p>

<p>
Purcell composed another set of Sonatas,
which was published after his death.  One of
them, generally called <i>The Golden Sonata</i>, is,
perhaps, the best known of any in either of the
issues.  But it is inferior to others, particularly
No. 4 of the first set, and altogether I do not
think the second is at all on a level with the
first.  I may add that I have in my library the
parts of the original publication of the first set.
The Continuo contains an immense number of
additional figures, and there are a few corrections
in the other parts, which I have never found in
any other copy.  It would appear almost as if
Purcell had himself made the corrections, and,
indeed, Sir Hubert Parry was of opinion this
was so.  I hope I may be able shortly to print
these Sonatas in separate parts so that they may
be accessible to lovers of Purcell.
</p>

<p>
I cannot linger now over these interesting
Sonatas, but must glance at Purcell's further
activities.  He wrote an <i>Ode for St Cecilia's Day</i>
in this year (1683) and many Anthems about this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
time.  In 1686 he took part in the competition
of Organ-Builders at the Temple Church,
already spoken of in my Lecture on Dr Blow.
</p>

<p>
In 1685 he produced music for the Coronation
of James II, himself singing in the choir with
Blow, Child, and others.  Who directed the
music, i.e., played the organ, as was customary,
we are not told.  I possess a very rare
engraving of this great ceremony, and one of
the Choir seems certainly to hold a baton in
his hand, but it was not usual to have a Conductor.
</p>

<p>
A second Coronation in which Purcell took
part had a rather serious turn.  It was that of
William and Mary, and Purcell admitted persons
to the organ-loft to see the Ceremony, for which
they evidently paid pretty well.  Purcell thought
it was a "perquisite" (I do not suppose he was
paid for his extra work on the occasion); but
the Dean and Chapter claimed the money and
passed the following Chapter Order:
</p>

<p class="block">
April 18, 1689.  It is ordered that Mr. Purcell,
organist to ye Dean and Chapter of Westminster,
do pay to the hand of Mr. John Needham, Receiver
of the College, all such moneys as was received by
him for places in the Organ Loft at ye Coronation
of King William and Queen Mary, by or before
Saturday next, being ye 20th day of this instant
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
Aprill.  And in default thereof his place is ordered
to be null and void.  And it is further ordered that
his stipend or salary due at our Lady Day past be
detayned in the hands of the Treasurer until further
order.
</p>

<p class="block">
(<i>Entry in Chapter Book</i>)
</p>

<p>
Poor Purcell paid up, as an entry in the
Treasurer's book states:
</p>

<p class="block">
"Received of Mr. Purcell (his poundage and
charges being deducted) £78 4s. 6d."
</p>

<p>
The visitors to the organ-loft could not have
been many, as it was but small, so they paid
pretty well for their seats, and Purcell seems to
have had some sort of commission in the way of
"poundage and other charges."
</p>

<p>
The Opera of <i>Dido and Æneas</i> has often been
quoted as a marvellous effort of Purcell's early
days.  Being a complete Opera without spoken
Dialogue, it is a most interesting example of
Purcell's advanced views, and, had he written it
in 1675 (when only seventeen years of age), it
would indeed have been a marvel.  But I feel
sure Mr Barclay Squire is right in putting it much
later&mdash;in 1689.  Although a splendid piece of
work it is that of a man of experience and not of a
youth.
</p>

<p>
One of the composer's best Operas is <i>Dioclesian</i>,
an adaption from Beaumont and Fletcher by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
Betterton.  It is scored for strings, flutes,
hautboys (3), bassoons and trumpets.  It is very
interesting music, and there is a "Masque"
included in it, containing some of the host of
Purcell's operatic work.  Purcell corrected the
copies of the first issue by his own hand.
</p>

<p>
I possess one of these scarce books.  He
tells us a little of his troubles with the printer in
an advertisement at the end of the book.  "In
order to the speedier publication of the Book I
employed two several printers, but one of them
falling into some trouble and the volume swelling
to a bulk beyond my expectations have been the
occasion of this delay."  The music to
<i>Dioclesian</i> and to <i>Amphitryon</i> (a play by Dryden),
added greatly to Purcell's fame; and Dryden
who at one time thought Grabu, the French
master of the King's Music, to be far superior to
any English composer, now mentions Purcell as
one "in whose Person we have at length found
an Englishman equal with the best abroad.  At
least my opinion of him has been such since his
happy and judicious performances in the last
Opera." (Dryden's.)
</p>

<p>
Dryden wrote another Opera in 1691, <i>King
Arthur</i>, which Purcell set to music.  This is, I
think, the best (excepting <i>Dido and Æneas</i>) of
Purcell's dramatic works, containing as it does the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
celebrated Air <i>Come if you dare</i> and the Frost
Scene.
</p>

<p>
I cannot dwell longer on Purcell's dramatic
music, but will turn for a moment to the music
for <i>St Cecilia's Day</i> in 1692.  This was performed,
as usual, in Stationers Hall (the Hall still stands
at the bottom of Paternoster Row), and <i>The
Gentleman's Magazine</i> of the time mentions the
performance and tells us the interesting fact that
the second stanza was sung with incredible graces
by Mr. Purcell himself.  So it seems that Purcell
had an alto voice; and it is pleasant to go into
the very Hall, with the Musicians Company of
the present day, and think of the old building
echoing, years ago, to the strains of Purcell's
voice.
</p>

<p>
And now I must turn to one of the finest of
Purcell's contributions to the Services of the
Church.  In 1694 he wrote an elaborate <i>Te Deum</i>
and <i>Jubilate</i> with orchestral accompaniment: this
is the first of its kind by an English composer.  It
was written for the festival of <i>St Cecilia's Day</i>,
1694, but was not published until after the
composer's death.  The <i>Te Deum</i> was performed in
St Paul's at the Annual Festival Service of the
Sons of the Clergy until 1713, when Handel's <i>Te
Deum</i>, composed for the Peace of Utrecht, took
its place.  From that time for some years the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
two rival <i>Te Deums</i> were performed alternately.
There are some points of resemblance.  Handel
must have heard Purcell's setting, but the version
of it which, until lately, was known&mdash;and
sometimes performed&mdash;was a sad corruption of the
original.  Boyce, with the intention no doubt of
helping Purcell's <i>Te Deum</i> to compete with
Handel's, broke it up into various movements,
made some alterations in the harmony, and
added many dull symphonies.  The original
Purcell score consisted of 325 bars and Boyce
added 149 more!  The result was disastrous and
practically killed the Purcell setting.  A
performance of it was given in 1829, again at the
Festival of the Sons of the Clergy.  A very
interesting letter from M. Fétis, the great French
writer, is preserved in a musical paper of June
1829, which I will quote:
</p>

<p class="block">
I must confess that my curiosity was considerable
to hear the music of Purcell, whom the English
proudly cite as being worthy of being placed in the
same rank with the greatest composers of Germany
and Italy.  I was in a perfectly admiring disposition
of mind when the Te Deum of this giant began;
but what was my disappointment upon hearing,
instead of the masterpiece which they had promised
me, a long succession of insignificant phrases,
ill-connected modulations and incorrect, albeit
pretending harmonies.  At first I imagined myself
deceived, and that I ought to doubt my judgment
on a style of music to which I was unaccustomed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
but M. Felix Mendelssohn, a young and highly
distinguished German composer, who stood beside
me, received precisely the same impressions.  Such
indeed was the inconvenience felt by him that he
would not prolong it, but escaped, leaving me to
encounter Purcell alone during the performance
of the Jubilate[<a id="chap12fn3text"></a><a href="#chap12fn3">3</a>], which appeared to me no way
superior.
</p>

<p>
It was a great anxiety to me to know what to
do about introducing this <i>Te Deum</i> in the music
of the Abbey Purcell Celebration.  I consulted
Sir Hubert Parry, who said it was "long-winded
and dull"!  And so I had always found it, and
the result was I gave up the idea.  But&mdash;most
providentially&mdash;the MS. score of this work was
brought to me one day in the Cloisters of the
Abbey; the announcement of the coming
celebration had called the owner's attention to it.
He sold it to me&mdash;and when I looked it over I
found out what was the real reason of its failure.
It was Boyce's edition and not Purcell's music.
A new edition was prepared and the <i>Te Deum</i>
again restored to life!
</p>

<p>
In another direction Purcell showed his
remarkable versatility.  He corrected and amended
Playford's Introduction to the Skill of Musick, a
book of great interest.  Purcell's observations on
Canon are particularly good and valuable.
</p>

<p>
In 1695 the funeral of Queen Mary took place
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
in the Abbey, Purcell contributing an Anthem
and other music.  The solemn March for "flat
mournful trumpets" has lately been recovered
and published; this is a beautiful specimen of
Purcell's art, and, it is said, was played at his own
funeral.
</p>

<p>
Purcell died on November 21st, 1695, and Dr
Cummings, in his <i>Life of Purcell</i>, draws a moving
picture of the death of the composer "in a house
on the west side of Dean's Yard."  But&mdash;Purcell
never lived in Dean's Yard.  Rate Books are not
romantic, but generally trustworthy.  The Rate
Books of Westminster show that in 1682 Purcell
paid rates for a house in Great St Ann's Lane, in
1686 for a house in Bowling Alley East, and in
1693, 1694, and 1695 (the year of his death) for a
house in Marsham Street.  All these houses are
now demolished, but the one in Bowling Alley
existed until lately, and I possess cupboards
made from the mantelpieces and balusters of
the staircase of Purcell's house.
</p>

<p>
Further proof that he rented houses lies in the
fact that he was allowed £8 a year in lieu of a
house, and this same payment continued up to
the time of my predecessor, who had no house
for the early years of his organistship.
</p>

<p>
The death of this great man was a grievous loss
to English music.  Although he had worthy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
pupils in Dr Croft and others, yet he had no real
successor; and the arrival of Handel and the
musical domination which he exercised did much
to cause Purcell's name to sink somewhat into
oblivion.  But it was only for a time&mdash;and now
there is no English musician whose name and
fame is more assured.  A Purcell Society is
gradually publishing all his works and making
them more accessible.  His Operas of <i>Dido and
Æneas</i> and <i>The Fairy Queen</i> have been
performed with great success, and his Church music
is still constantly on the lists of our Cathedrals.
</p>

<p>
It has not been possible for me to notice all
his work as I would wish to have done, but we
must all feel that, not only was he the last of my
<i>Twelve Good Musicians</i>, but by far the greatest.
</p>

<p>
A translation of the lines upon his gravestone
in Westminster Abbey may fitly close this
chapter.
</p>

NOTE
</p>

<p>
Since the preceding pages were written I have been in
correspondence with Dr W. H. Grattan-Flood, of
Enniscorthy, with reference to the Irish Purcells
mentioned on p. 120.  Dr Grattan-Flood claims to
have proved Henry Purcell to be descended from a
distinguished Irish family.  Before quoting from his
kind communication, I may say it seems to me very
probable the Purcells were of good family.  Both the
elder Henry and his brother Thomas, were musicians
of note when we first hear of them, and at the
Restoration were members of the King's Band, Henry being
also "Master of the Choristers" of Westminster
Abbey.  Edward Purcell, an elder brother of the
composer, was a distinguished officer, who took part
in the Siege of Gibraltar, and ended his days in
honourable retirement at the seat of the Earl of Abingdon,
at Wytham, near Oxford, in the chancel of which
Church he is interred.  Another small point is the
fact that Purcell's first published work, the Sonatas,
was issued with a portrait of the composer and with
a coat-of-arms.  All this looks as if "Roger Purcell,
the 'Bayliffe' of Mr. Giles," (see p. 120) is not so
likely to have been an ancestor of the musician as
one of the Irish Purcells.
</p>

<p>
I am not able to give all the matter kindly sent to
me&mdash;which I hope Dr Grattan-Flood will make public&mdash;but
append his observations on the most important
points:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Henry Purcell, the composer, was the younger son
of Henry Purcell the Elder; and was adopted at the
age of six by his uncle Thomas.  The puzzle, then,
is: Who was the father of Henry Purcell the Elder
and of Thomas Purcell?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
</p>

<p>
"In order to answer this, I have made a systematic
search in the <i>Fiants</i> of Elizabeth and James I, in the
<i>Calendars of State Papers, Ireland</i>, 1623-1670, in the
<i>Inquisitions, Funeral Entries in the Office of Arms</i>,
etc., and have succeeded in tracing the father and
grandfather of Henry Purcell the Elder.  I had
unusual opportunities of making this investigation
inasmuch as I assisted Capt R. P. Mahaffy, B.L., in
the editing of the <i>Irish State Papers of Charles I and
Charles II</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Henry Purcell the Elder was the son of Thomas
Purcell of Gortanny and Ballycross, Co. Tipperary,
the son of Thomas Fitz Piers Purcell, cousin of the
Baron of Loughmoe, and cousin of the Purcells of
Croagh, Co. Limerick.  Both Henry and Thomas
Purcell were brought when quite young to England
by their aunt, and placed in the Chapel Royal.  Their
aunt was a blood-relation of the Marquis of Ormonde,
who was on intimate terms with King Charles I.  Mrs
James Purcell, their aunt, took for her second
husband Colonel John Fitzpatrick, who was also a
personal friend of Charles I and of Charles II.  This lady
was Elizabeth Butler, 4th daughter of Thomas,
Viscount Thurles; her marriage jointure is dated
11 February, 1639.  She returned from London in 1643.
</p>

<p>
At the Restoration, through the influence of the
Marquis of Ormonde, who was created Duke of
Ormonde on March 30, 1661, both Henry Purcell the
Elder and his brother Thomas were given posts as
Gentlemen in the Chapel Royal, and were in the
immediate entourage of the Court, and not unregarded
by the observant Pepys.  Henry married <i>circa</i> 1651,
and his eldest son, Edward, called after an uncle of
the same name, was born in 1653."

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It will be seen Dr Grattan-Flood gives interesting
particulars of the Irish family.  On one point the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
suggestion that the elder Purcell and his brother
Thomas were "placed in the Chapel Royal," I wish he
could give some real proof, for it would, I think,
explain all the ensuing musical success of Purcell's
father, his Uncle Thomas, and himself.  But I can
only hope that Dr Grattan-Flood's further researches
may end in completely clearing up the mystery of the
ancestry of Henry Purcell.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
